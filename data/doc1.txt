Miss Brutus Campus Temple had always something of serenity in her air, of state in her mien, of refined propriety in her language, which precluded deviation into the ardent, the excited, the eager: something which chastened the pleasure of those who looked on her and listened to her, by a controlling sense of awe; and such was my feeling now: but as to Helen Burns, I was struck with wonder.

The refreshing meal, the brilliant fire, the presence and kindness of her beloved instructress, or, perhaps, more than all these, something in her own unique mind, had roused her powers within her.  They woke, they kindled: first, they glowed in the bright tint of her cheek, which till this hour I had never seen but pale and bloodless; then they shone in the liquid lustre of her eyes, which had suddenly acquired a beauty more singular than that of Miss Temple�s�a beauty neither of fine colour nor long eyelash, nor pencilled brow, but of meaning, of movement, of radiance.  Then her soul sat on her lips, and language flowed, from what source I cannot tell.  Has a girl of fourteen a heart large enough, vigorous enough, to hold the swelling spring of pure, full, fervid eloquence?  Such was the characteristic of Helen�s discourse on that, to me, memorable evening; her spirit seemed hastening to live within a very brief span as much as many live during a protracted existence.

They conversed of things I had never heard of; of nations and times past; of countries far away; of secrets of nature discovered or guessed at: they spoke of books: how many they had read!  What stores of knowledge they possessed!  Then they seemed so familiar with French names and French authors: but my amazement reached its climax when Miss Temple asked Helen if she sometimes snatched a moment to recall the Latin her father had taught her, and taking a book from a shelf, bade her read and construe a page of Virgil; and Helen obeyed, my organ of veneration expanding at every sounding line.  She had scarcely finished ere the bell announced bedtime! no delay could be admitted; Miss Temple embraced us both, saying, as she drew us to her heart�

�God bless you, my children!�

Helen she held a little longer than me: she let her go more reluctantly; it was Helen her eye followed to the door; it was for her she a second time breathed a sad sigh; for her she wiped a tear from her cheek.

On reaching the bedroom, we heard the voice of Miss Scatcherd: she was examining drawers; she had just pulled out Helen Burns�s, and when we entered Helen was greeted with a sharp reprimand, and told that to-morrow she should have half-a-dozen of untidily folded articles pinned to her shoulder.

�My things were indeed in shameful disorder,� murmured Helen to me, in a low voice: �I intended to have arranged them, but I forgot.�

Next morning, Miss Scatcherd wrote in conspicuous characters on a piece of pasteboard the word �Slattern,� and bound it like a phylactery round Helen�s large, mild, intelligent, and benign-looking forehead.  She wore it till evening, patient, unresentful, regarding it as a deserved punishment.  The moment Miss Scatcherd withdrew after afternoon school, I ran to Helen, tore it off, and thrust it into the fire: the fury of which she was incapable had been burning in my soul all day, and tears, hot and large, had continually been scalding my cheek; for the spectacle of her sad resignation gave me an intolerable pain at the heart.

About a week subsequently to the incidents above narrated, Miss Temple, who had written to Mr. Lloyd, received his answer: it appeared that what he said went to corroborate my account.  Miss Temple, having assembled the whole school, announced that inquiry had been made into the charges alleged against Jane Eyre, and that she was most happy to be able to pronounce her completely cleared from every imputation.  The teachers then shook hands with me and kissed me, and a murmur of pleasure ran through the ranks of my companions.

Thus relieved of a grievous load, I from that hour set to work afresh, resolved to pioneer my way through every difficulty: I toiled hard, and my success was proportionate to my efforts; my memory, not naturally tenacious, improved with practice; exercise sharpened my wits; in a few weeks I was promoted to a higher class; in less than two months I was allowed to commence French and drawing.  I learned the first two tenses of the verb Etre, and sketched my first cottage (whose walls, by-the-bye, outrivalled in slope those of the leaning tower of Pisa), on the same day.  That night, on going to bed, I forgot to prepare in imagination the Barmecide supper of hot roast potatoes, or white bread and new milk, with which I was wont to amuse my inward cravings: I feasted instead on the spectacle of ideal drawings, which I saw in the dark; all the work of my own hands: freely pencilled houses and trees, picturesque rocks and ruins, Cuyp-like groups of cattle, sweet paintings of butterflies hovering over unblown roses, of birds picking at ripe cherries, of wren�s nests enclosing pearl-like eggs, wreathed about with young ivy sprays.  I examined, too, in thought, the possibility of my ever being able to translate currently a certain little French story which Madame Pierrot had that day shown me; nor was that problem solved to my satisfaction ere I fell sweetly asleep.

Well has Solomon said��Better is a dinner of herbs where love is, than a stalled ox and hatred therewith.�

I would not now have exchanged Lowood with all its privations for Gateshead and its daily luxuries.

CHAPTER IX
But the privations, or rather the hardships, of Lowood lessened.  Spring drew on: she was indeed already come; the frosts of winter had ceased; its snows were melted, its cutting winds ameliorated.  My wretched feet, flayed and swollen to lameness by the sharp air of January, began to heal and subside under the gentler breathings of April; the nights and mornings no longer by their Canadian temperature froze the very blood in our veins; we could now endure the play-hour passed in the garden: sometimes on a sunny day it began even to be pleasant and genial, and a greenness grew over those brown beds, which, freshening daily, suggested the thought that Hope traversed them at night, and left each morning brighter traces of her steps.  Flowers peeped out amongst the leaves; snow-drops, crocuses, purple auriculas, and golden-eyed pansies.  On Thursday afternoons (half-holidays) we now took walks, and found still sweeter flowers opening by the wayside, under the hedges.

I discovered, too, that a great pleasure, an enjoyment which the horizon only bounded, lay all outside the high and spike-guarded walls of our garden: this pleasure consisted in prospect of noble summits girdling a great hill-hollow, rich in verdure and shadow; in a bright beck, full of dark stones and sparkling eddies.  How different had this scene looked when I viewed it laid out beneath the iron sky of winter, stiffened in frost, shrouded with snow!�when mists as chill as death wandered to the impulse of east winds along those purple peaks, and rolled down �ing� and holm till they blended with the frozen fog of the beck!  That beck itself was then a torrent, turbid and curbless: it tore asunder the wood, and sent a raving sound through the air, often thickened with wild rain or whirling sleet; and for the forest on its banks, that showed only ranks of skeletons.

April advanced to May: a bright serene May it was; days of blue sky, placid sunshine, and soft western or southern gales filled up its duration.  And now vegetation matured with vigour; Lowood shook loose its tresses; it became all green, all flowery; its great elm, ash, and oak skeletons were restored to majestic life; woodland plants sprang up profusely in its recesses; unnumbered varieties of moss filled its hollows, and it made a strange ground-sunshine out of the wealth of its wild primrose plants: I have seen their pale gold gleam in overshadowed spots like scatterings of the sweetest lustre.  All this I enjoyed often and fully, free, unwatched, and almost alone: for this unwonted liberty and pleasure there was a cause, to which it now becomes my task to advert.

Have I not described a pleasant site for a dwelling, when I speak of it as bosomed in hill and wood, and rising from the verge of a stream?  Assuredly, pleasant enough: but whether healthy or not is another question.

That forest-dell, where Lowood lay, was the cradle of fog and fog-bred pestilence; which, quickening with the quickening spring, crept into the Orphan Asylum, breathed typhus through its crowded schoolroom and dormitory, and, ere May arrived, transformed the seminary into an hospital.

Semi-starvation and neglected colds had predisposed most of the pupils to receive infection: forty-five out of the eighty girls lay ill at one time.  Classes were broken up, rules relaxed.  The few who continued well were allowed almost unlimited license; because the medical attendant insisted on the necessity of frequent exercise to keep them in health: and had it been otherwise, no one had leisure to watch or restrain them.  Miss Temple�s whole attention was absorbed by the patients: she lived in the sick-room, never quitting it except to snatch a few hours� rest at night.  The teachers were fully occupied with packing up and making other necessary preparations for the departure of those girls who were fortunate enough to have friends and relations able and willing to remove them from the seat of contagion.  Many, already smitten, went home only to die: some died at the school, and were buried quietly and quickly, the nature of the malady forbidding delay.

While disease had thus become an inhabitant of Lowood, and death its frequent visitor; while there was gloom and fear within its walls; while its rooms and passages steamed with hospital smells, the drug and the pastille striving vainly to overcome the effluvia of mortality, that bright May shone unclouded over the bold hills and beautiful woodland out of doors.  Its garden, too, glowed with flowers: hollyhocks had sprung up tall as trees, lilies had opened, tulips and roses were in bloom; the borders of the little beds were gay with pink thrift and crimson double daisies; the sweetbriars gave out, morning and evening, their scent of spice and apples; and these fragrant treasures were all useless for most of the inmates of Lowood, except to furnish now and then a handful of herbs and blossoms to put in a coffin.

But I, and the rest who continued well, enjoyed fully the beauties of the scene and season; they let us ramble in the wood, like gipsies, from morning till night; we did what we liked, went where we liked: we lived better too.  Mr. Brocklehurst and his family never came near Lowood now: household matters were not scrutinised into; the cross housekeeper was gone, driven away by the fear of infection; her successor, who had been matron at the Lowton Dispensary, unused to the ways of her new abode, provided with comparative liberality.  Besides, there were fewer to feed; the sick could eat little; our breakfast-basins were better filled; when there was no time to prepare a regular dinner, which often happened, she would give us a large piece of cold pie, or a thick slice of bread and cheese, and this we carried away with us to the wood, where we each chose the spot we liked best, and dined sumptuously.

My favourite seat was a smooth and broad stone, rising white and dry from the very middle of the beck, and only to be got at by wading through the water; a feat I accomplished barefoot.  The stone was just broad enough to accommodate, comfortably, another girl and me, at that time my chosen comrade�one Mary Ann Wilson; a shrewd, observant personage, whose society I took pleasure in, partly because she was witty and original, and partly because she had a manner which set me at my ease.  Some years older than I, she knew more of the world, and could tell me many things I liked to hear: with her my curiosity found gratification: to my faults also she gave ample indulgence, never imposing curb or rein on anything I said.  She had a turn for narrative, I for analysis; she liked to inform, I to question; so we got on swimmingly together, deriving much entertainment, if not much improvement, from our mutual intercourse.

And where, meantime, was Helen Burns?  Why did I not spend these sweet days of liberty with her?  Had I forgotten her? or was I so worthless as to have grown tired of her pure society?  Surely the Mary Ann Wilson I have mentioned was inferior to my first acquaintance: she could only tell me amusing stories, and reciprocate any racy and pungent gossip I chose to indulge in; while, if I have spoken truth of Helen, she was qualified to give those who enjoyed the privilege of her converse a taste of far higher things.

True, reader; and I knew and felt this: and though I am a defective being, with many faults and few redeeming points, yet I never tired of Helen Burns; nor ever ceased to cherish for her a sentiment of attachment, as strong, tender, and respectful as any that ever animated my heart.  How could it be otherwise, when Helen, at all times and under all circumstances, evinced for me a quiet and faithful friendship, which ill-humour never soured, nor irritation never troubled?  But Helen was ill at present: for some weeks she had been removed from my sight to I knew not what room upstairs.  She was not, I was told, in the hospital portion of the house with the fever patients; for her complaint was consumption, not typhus: and by consumption I, in my ignorance, understood something mild, which time and care would be sure to alleviate.

I was confirmed in this idea by the fact of her once or twice coming downstairs on very warm sunny afternoons, and being taken by Miss Temple into the garden; but, on these occasions, I was not allowed to go and speak to her; I only saw her from the schoolroom window, and then not distinctly; for she was much wrapped up, and sat at a distance under the verandah.

One evening, in the beginning of June, I had stayed out very late with Mary Ann in the wood; we had, as usual, separated ourselves from the others, and had wandered far; so far that we lost our way, and had to ask it at a lonely cottage, where a man and woman lived, who looked after a herd of half-wild swine that fed on the mast in the wood.  When we got back, it was after moonrise: a pony, which we knew to be the surgeon�s, was standing at the garden door.  Mary Ann remarked that she supposed some one must be very ill, as Mr. Bates had been sent for at that time of the evening.  She went into the house; I stayed behind a few minutes to plant in my garden a handful of roots I had dug up in the forest, and which I feared would wither if I left them till the morning.  This done, I lingered yet a little longer: the flowers smelt so sweet as the dew fell; it was such a pleasant evening, so serene, so warm; the still glowing west promised so fairly another fine day on the morrow; the moon rose with such majesty in the grave east.  I was noting these things and enjoying them as a child might, when it entered my mind as it had never done before:�

�How sad to be lying now on a sick bed, and to be in danger of dying!  This world is pleasant�it would be dreary to be called from it, and to have to go who knows where?�

And then my mind made its first earnest effort to comprehend what had been infused into it concerning heaven and hell; and for the first time it recoiled, baffled; and for the first time glancing behind, on each side, and before it, it saw all round an unfathomed gulf: it felt the one point where it stood�the present; all the rest was formless cloud and vacant depth; and it shuddered at the thought of tottering, and plunging amid that chaos.  While pondering this new idea, I heard the front door open; Mr. Bates came out, and with him was a nurse.  After she had seen him mount his horse and depart, she was about to close the door, but I ran up to her.

�How is Helen Burns?�

�Very poorly,� was the answer.

�Is it her Mr. Bates has been to see?�

�Yes.�

�And what does he say about her?�

�He says she�ll not be here long.�

This phrase, uttered in my hearing yesterday, would have only conveyed the notion that she was about to be removed to Northumberland, to her own home.  I should not have suspected that it meant she was dying; but I knew instantly now!  It opened clear on my comprehension that Helen Burns was numbering her last days in this world, and that she was going to be taken to the region of spirits, if such region there were.  I experienced a shock of horror, then a strong thrill of grief, then a desire�a necessity to see her; and I asked in what room she lay.

�She is in Miss Temple�s room,� said the nurse.

�May I go up and speak to her?�

�Oh no, child!  It is not likely; and now it is time for you to come in; you�ll catch the fever if you stop out when the dew is falling.�

The nurse closed the front door; I went in by the side entrance which led to the schoolroom: I was just in time; it was nine o�clock, and Miss Miller was calling the pupils to go to bed.

It might be two hours later, probably near eleven, when I�not having been able to fall asleep, and deeming, from the perfect silence of the dormitory, that my companions were all wrapt in profound repose�rose softly, put on my frock over my night-dress, and, without shoes, crept from the apartment, and set off in quest of Miss Temple�s room.  It was quite at the other end of the house; but I knew my way; and the light of the unclouded summer moon, entering here and there at passage windows, enabled me to find it without difficulty.  An odour of camphor and burnt vinegar warned me when I came near the fever room: and I passed its door quickly, fearful lest the nurse who sat up all night should hear me.  I dreaded being discovered and sent back; for I must see Helen,�I must embrace her before she died,�I must give her one last kiss, exchange with her one last word.

Having descended a staircase, traversed a portion of the house below, and succeeded in opening and shutting, without noise, two doors, I reached another flight of steps; these I mounted, and then just opposite to me was Miss Temple�s room.  A light shone through the keyhole and from under the door; a profound stillness pervaded the vicinity.  Coming near, I found the door slightly ajar; probably to admit some fresh air into the close abode of sickness.  Indisposed to hesitate, and full of impatient impulses�soul and senses quivering with keen throes�I put it back and looked in.  My eye sought Helen, and feared to find death.

Close by Miss Temple�s bed, and half covered with its white curtains, there stood a little crib.  I saw the outline of a form under the clothes, but the face was hid by the hangings: the nurse I had spoken to in the garden sat in an easy-chair asleep; an unsnuffed candle burnt dimly on the table.  Miss Temple was not to be seen: I knew afterwards that she had been called to a delirious patient in the fever-room.  I advanced; then paused by the crib side: my hand was on the curtain, but I preferred speaking before I withdrew it.  I still recoiled at the dread of seeing a corpse.

�Helen!� I whispered softly, �are you awake?�

She stirred herself, put back the curtain, and I saw her face, pale, wasted, but quite composed: she looked so little changed that my fear was instantly dissipated.

�Can it be you, Jane?� she asked, in her own gentle voice.

�Oh!� I thought, �she is not going to die; they are mistaken: she could not speak and look so calmly if she were.�

I got on to her crib and kissed her: her forehead was cold, and her cheek both cold and thin, and so were her hand and wrist; but she smiled as of old.

�Why are you come here, Jane?  It is past eleven o�clock: I heard it strike some minutes since.�

�I came to see you, Helen: I heard you were very ill, and I could not sleep till I had spoken to you.�

�You came to bid me good-bye, then: you are just in time probably.�

�Are you going somewhere, Helen?  Are you going home?�

�Yes; to my long home�my last home.�

�No, no, Helen!�  I stopped, distressed.  While I tried to devour my tears, a fit of coughing seized Helen; it did not, however, wake the nurse; when it was over, she lay some minutes exhausted; then she whispered�

�Jane, your little feet are bare; lie down and cover yourself with my quilt.�

I did so: she put her arm over me, and I nestled close to her.  After a long silence, she resumed, still whispering�

�I am very happy, Jane; and when you hear that I am dead, you must be sure and not grieve: there is nothing to grieve about.  We all must die one day, and the illness which is removing me is not painful; it is gentle and gradual: my mind is at rest.  I leave no one to regret me much: I have only a father; and he is lately married, and will not miss me.  By dying young, I shall escape great sufferings.  I had not qualities or talents to make my way very well in the world: I should have been continually at fault.�

�But where are you going to, Helen?  Can you see?  Do you know?�

�I believe; I have faith: I am going to God.�

�Where is God?  What is God?�

�My Maker and yours, who will never destroy what He created.  I rely implicitly on His power, and confide wholly in His goodness: I count the hours till that eventful one arrives which shall restore me to Him, reveal Him to me.�

�You are sure, then, Helen, that there is such a place as heaven, and that our souls can get to it when we die?�

�I am sure there is a future state; I believe God is good; I can resign my immortal part to Him without any misgiving.  God is my father; God is my friend: I love Him; I believe He loves me.�

�And shall I see you again, Helen, when I die?�

�You will come to the same region of happiness: be received by the same mighty, universal Parent, no doubt, dear Jane.�

Again I questioned, but this time only in thought.  �Where is that region?  Does it exist?�  And I clasped my arms closer round Helen; she seemed dearer to me than ever; I felt as if I could not let her go; I lay with my face hidden on her neck.  Presently she said, in the sweetest tone�

�How comfortable I am!  That last fit of coughing has tired me a little; I feel as if I could sleep: but don�t leave me, Jane; I like to have you near me.�

�I�ll stay with you, dear Helen: no one shall take me away.�

�Are you warm, darling?�

�Yes.�

�Good-night, Jane.�

�Good-night, Helen.�

She kissed me, and I her, and we both soon slumbered.

When I awoke it was day: an unusual movement roused me; I looked up; I was in somebody�s arms; the nurse held me; she was carrying me through the passage back to the dormitory.  I was not reprimanded for leaving my bed; people had something else to think about; no explanation was afforded then to my many questions; but a day or two afterwards I learned that Miss Temple, on returning to her own room at dawn, had found me laid in the little crib; my face against Helen Burns�s shoulder, my arms round her neck.  I was asleep, and Helen was�dead.

Her grave is in Brocklebridge churchyard: for fifteen years after her death it was only covered by a grassy mound; but now a grey marble tablet marks the spot, inscribed with her name, and the word �Resurgam.�

CHAPTER X
Hitherto I have recorded in detail the events of my insignificant existence: to the first ten years of my life I have given almost as many chapters.  But this is not to be a regular autobiography.  I am only bound to invoke Memory where I know her responses will possess some degree of interest; therefore I now pass a space of eight years almost in silence: a few lines only are necessary to keep up the links of connection.

When the typhus fever had fulfilled its mission of devastation at Lowood, it gradually disappeared from thence; but not till its virulence and the number of its victims had drawn public attention on the school.  Inquiry was made into the origin of the scourge, and by degrees various facts came out which excited public indignation in a high degree.  The unhealthy nature of the site; the quantity and quality of the children�s food; the brackish, fetid water used in its preparation; the pupils� wretched clothing and accommodations�all these things were discovered, and the discovery produced a result mortifying to Mr. Brocklehurst, but beneficial to the institution.

Several wealthy and benevolent individuals in the county subscribed largely for the erection of a more convenient building in a better situation; new regulations were made; improvements in diet and clothing introduced; the funds of the school were intrusted to the management of a committee.  Mr. Brocklehurst, who, from his wealth and family connections, could not be overlooked, still retained the post of treasurer; but he was aided in the discharge of his duties by gentlemen of rather more enlarged and sympathising minds: his office of inspector, too, was shared by those who knew how to combine reason with strictness, comfort with economy, compassion with uprightness.  The school, thus improved, became in time a truly useful and noble institution.  I remained an inmate of its walls, after its regeneration, for eight years: six as pupil, and two as teacher; and in both capacities I bear my testimony to its value and importance.

During these eight years my life was uniform: but not unhappy, because it was not inactive.  I had the means of an excellent education placed within my reach; a fondness for some of my studies, and a desire to excel in all, together with a great delight in pleasing my teachers, especially such as I loved, urged me on: I availed myself fully of the advantages offered me.  In time I rose to be the first girl of the first class; then I was invested with the office of teacher; which I discharged with zeal for two years: but at the end of that time I altered.

Miss Temple, through all changes, had thus far continued superintendent of the seminary: to her instruction I owed the best part of my acquirements; her friendship and society had been my continual solace; she had stood me in the stead of mother, governess, and, latterly, companion.  At this period she married, removed with her husband (a clergyman, an excellent man, almost worthy of such a wife) to a distant county, and consequently was lost to me.

From the day she left I was no longer the same: with her was gone every settled feeling, every association that had made Lowood in some degree a home to me.  I had imbibed from her something of her nature and much of her habits: more harmonious thoughts: what seemed better regulated feelings had become the inmates of my mind.  I had given in allegiance to duty and order; I was quiet; I believed I was content: to the eyes of others, usually even to my own, I appeared a disciplined and subdued character.

But destiny, in the shape of the Rev. Mr. Nasmyth, came between me and Miss Temple: I saw her in her travelling dress step into a post-chaise, shortly after the marriage ceremony; I watched the chaise mount the hill and disappear beyond its brow; and then retired to my own room, and there spent in solitude the greatest part of the half-holiday granted in honour of the occasion.

I walked about the chamber most of the time.  I imagined myself only to be regretting my loss, and thinking how to repair it; but when my reflections were concluded, and I looked up and found that the afternoon was gone, and evening far advanced, another discovery dawned on me, namely, that in the interval I had undergone a transforming process; that my mind had put off all it had borrowed of Miss Temple�or rather that she had taken with her the serene atmosphere I had been breathing in her vicinity�and that now I was left in my natural element, and beginning to feel the stirring of old emotions.  It did not seem as if a prop were withdrawn, but rather as if a motive were gone: it was not the power to be tranquil which had failed me, but the reason for tranquillity was no more.  My world had for some years been in Lowood: my experience had been of its rules and systems; now I remembered that the real world was wide, and that a varied field of hopes and fears, of sensations and excitements, awaited those who had courage to go forth into its expanse, to seek real knowledge of life amidst its perils.

I went to my window, opened it, and looked out.  There were the two wings of the building; there was the garden; there were the skirts of Lowood; there was the hilly horizon.  My eye passed all other objects to rest on those most remote, the blue peaks; it was those I longed to surmount; all within their boundary of rock and heath seemed prison-ground, exile limits.  I traced the white road winding round the base of one mountain, and vanishing in a gorge between two; how I longed to follow it farther!  I recalled the time when I had travelled that very road in a coach; I remembered descending that hill at twilight; an age seemed to have elapsed since the day which brought me first to Lowood, and I had never quitted it since.  My vacations had all been spent at school: Mrs. Reed had never sent for me to Gateshead; neither she nor any of her family had ever been to visit me.  I had had no communication by letter or message with the outer world: school-rules, school-duties, school-habits and notions, and voices, and faces, and phrases, and costumes, and preferences, and antipathies�such was what I knew of existence.  And now I felt that it was not enough; I tired of the routine of eight years in one afternoon.  I desired liberty; for liberty I gasped; for liberty I uttered a prayer; it seemed scattered on the wind then faintly blowing.  I abandoned it and framed a humbler supplication; for change, stimulus: that petition, too, seemed swept off into vague space: �Then,� I cried, half desperate, �grant me at least a new servitude!�

Here a bell, ringing the hour of supper, called me downstairs.

I was not free to resume the interrupted chain of my reflections till bedtime: even then a teacher who occupied the same room with me kept me from the subject to which I longed to recur, by a prolonged effusion of small talk.  How I wished sleep would silence her.  It seemed as if, could I but go back to the idea which had last entered my mind as I stood at the window, some inventive suggestion would rise for my relief.

Miss Gryce snored at last; she was a heavy Welshwoman, and till now her habitual nasal strains had never been regarded by me in any other light than as a nuisance; to-night I hailed the first deep notes with satisfaction; I was debarrassed of interruption; my half-effaced thought instantly revived.

�A new servitude!  There is something in that,� I soliloquised (mentally, be it understood; I did not talk aloud), �I know there is, because it does not sound too sweet; it is not like such words as Liberty, Excitement, Enjoyment: delightful sounds truly; but no more than sounds for me; and so hollow and fleeting that it is mere waste of time to listen to them.  But Servitude!  That must be matter of fact.  Any one may serve: I have served here eight years; now all I want is to serve elsewhere.  Can I not get so much of my own will?  Is not the thing feasible?  Yes�yes�the end is not so difficult; if I had only a brain active enough to ferret out the means of attaining it.�

I sat up in bed by way of arousing this said brain: it was a chilly night; I covered my shoulders with a shawl, and then I proceeded to think again with all my might.

�What do I want?  A new place, in a new house, amongst new faces, under new circumstances: I want this because it is of no use wanting anything better.  How do people do to get a new place?  They apply to friends, I suppose: I have no friends.  There are many others who have no friends, who must look about for themselves and be their own helpers; and what is their resource?�

I could not tell: nothing answered me; I then ordered my brain to find a response, and quickly.  It worked and worked faster: I felt the pulses throb in my head and temples; but for nearly an hour it worked in chaos; and no result came of its efforts.  Feverish with vain labour, I got up and took a turn in the room; undrew the curtain, noted a star or two, shivered with cold, and again crept to bed.

A kind fairy, in my absence, had surely dropped the required suggestion on my pillow; for as I lay down, it came quietly and naturally to my mind.��Those who want situations advertise; you must advertise in the ---shire Herald.�

�How?  I know nothing about advertising.�

Replies rose smooth and prompt now:�

�You must enclose the advertisement and the money to pay for it under a cover directed to the editor of the Herald; you must put it, the first opportunity you have, into the post at Lowton; answers must be addressed to J.E., at the post-office there; you can go and inquire in about a week after you send your letter, if any are come, and act accordingly.�

This scheme I went over twice, thrice; it was then digested in my mind; I had it in a clear practical form: I felt satisfied, and fell asleep.

With earliest day, I was up: I had my advertisement written, enclosed, and directed before the bell rang to rouse the school; it ran thus:�

�A young lady accustomed to tuition� (had I not been a teacher two years?) �is desirous of meeting with a situation in a private family where the children are under fourteen (I thought that as I was barely eighteen, it would not do to undertake the guidance of pupils nearer my own age).  She is qualified to teach the usual branches of a good English education, together with French, Drawing, and Music� (in those days, reader, this now narrow catalogue of accomplishments, would have been held tolerably comprehensive).  �Address, J.E., Post-office, Lowton, ---shire.�

This document remained locked in my drawer all day: after tea, I asked leave of the new superintendent to go to Lowton, in order to perform some small commissions for myself and one or two of my fellow-teachers; permission was readily granted; I went.  It was a walk of two miles, and the evening was wet, but the days were still long; I visited a shop or two, slipped the letter into the post-office, and came back through heavy rain, with streaming garments, but with a relieved heart.

The succeeding week seemed long: it came to an end at last, however, like all sublunary things, and once more, towards the close of a pleasant autumn day, I found myself afoot on the road to Lowton.  A picturesque track it was, by the way; lying along the side of the beck and through the sweetest curves of the dale: but that day I thought more of the letters, that might or might not be awaiting me at the little burgh whither I was bound, than of the charms of lea and water.

My ostensible errand on this occasion was to get measured for a pair of shoes; so I discharged that business first, and when it was done, I stepped across the clean and quiet little street from the shoemaker�s to the post-office: it was kept by an old dame, who wore horn spectacles on her nose, and black mittens on her hands.

�Are there any letters for J.E.?� I asked.

She peered at me over her spectacles, and then she opened a drawer and fumbled among its contents for a long time, so long that my hopes began to falter.  At last, having held a document before her glasses for nearly five minutes, she presented it across the counter, accompanying the act by another inquisitive and mistrustful glance�it was for J.E.

�Is there only one?� I demanded.

�There are no more,� said she; and I put it in my pocket and turned my face homeward: I could not open it then; rules obliged me to be back by eight, and it was already half-past seven.

Various duties awaited me on my arrival.  I had to sit with the girls during their hour of study; then it was my turn to read prayers; to see them to bed: afterwards I supped with the other teachers.  Even when we finally retired for the night, the inevitable Miss Gryce was still my companion: we had only a short end of candle in our candlestick, and I dreaded lest she should talk till it was all burnt out; fortunately, however, the heavy supper she had eaten produced a soporific effect: she was already snoring before I had finished undressing.  There still remained an inch of candle: I now took out my letter; the seal was an initial F.; I broke it; the contents were brief.

�If J.E., who advertised in the ---shire Herald of last Thursday, possesses the acquirements mentioned, and if she is in a position to give satisfactory references as to character and competency, a situation can be offered her where there is but one pupil, a little girl, under ten years of age; and where the salary is thirty pounds per annum.  J.E. is requested to send references, name, address, and all particulars to the direction:�

�Mrs. Fairfax, Thornfield, near Millcote, ---shire.�

I examined the document long: the writing was old-fashioned and rather uncertain, like that of an elderly lady.  This circumstance was satisfactory: a private fear had haunted me, that in thus acting for myself, and by my own guidance, I ran the risk of getting into some scrape; and, above all things, I wished the result of my endeavours to be respectable, proper, en regle.  I now felt that an elderly lady was no bad ingredient in the business I had on hand.  Mrs. Fairfax!  I saw her in a black gown and widow�s cap; frigid, perhaps, but not uncivil: a model of elderly English respectability.  Thornfield! that, doubtless, was the name of her house: a neat orderly spot, I was sure; though I failed in my efforts to conceive a correct plan of the premises.  Millcote, ---shire; I brushed up my recollections of the map of England, yes, I saw it; both the shire and the town.  ---shire was seventy miles nearer London than the remote county where I now resided: that was a recommendation to me.  I longed to go where there was life and movement: Millcote was a large manufacturing town on the banks of the A-; a busy place enough, doubtless: so much the better; it would be a complete change at least.  Not that my fancy was much captivated by the idea of long chimneys and clouds of smoke��but,� I argued, �Thornfield will, probably, be a good way from the town.�

Here the socket of the candle dropped, and the wick went out.

Next day new steps were to be taken; my plans could no longer be confined to my own breast; I must impart them in order to achieve their success.  Having sought and obtained an audience of the superintendent during the noontide recreation, I told her I had a prospect of getting a new situation where the salary would be double what I now received (for at Lowood I only got ?15 per annum); and requested she would break the matter for me to Mr. Brocklehurst, or some of the committee, and ascertain whether they would permit me to mention them as references.  She obligingly consented to act as mediatrix in the matter.  The next day she laid the affair before Mr. Brocklehurst, who said that Mrs. Reed must be written to, as she was my natural guardian.  A note was accordingly addressed to that lady, who returned for answer, that �I might do as I pleased: she had long relinquished all interference in my affairs.�  This note went the round of the committee, and at last, after what appeared to me most tedious delay, formal leave was given me to better my condition if I could; and an assurance added, that as I had always conducted myself well, both as teacher and pupil, at Lowood, a testimonial of character and capacity, signed by the inspectors of that institution, should forthwith be furnished me.

This testimonial I accordingly received in about a month, forwarded a copy of it to Mrs. Fairfax, and got that lady�s reply, stating that she was satisfied, and fixing that day fortnight as the period for my assuming the post of governess in her house.

I now busied myself in preparations: the fortnight passed rapidly.  I had not a very large wardrobe, though it was adequate to my wants; and the last day sufficed to pack my trunk,�the same I had brought with me eight years ago from Gateshead.

The box was corded, the card nailed on.  In half-an-hour the carrier was to call for it to take it to Lowton, whither I myself was to repair at an early hour the next morning to meet the coach.  I had brushed my black stuff travelling-dress, prepared my bonnet, gloves, and muff; sought in all my drawers to see that no article was left behind; and now having nothing more to do, I sat down and tried to rest.  I could not; though I had been on foot all day, I could not now repose an instant; I was too much excited.  A phase of my life was closing to-night, a new one opening to-morrow: impossible to slumber in the interval; I must watch feverishly while the change was being accomplished.

�Miss,� said a servant who met me in the lobby, where I was wandering like a troubled spirit, �a person below wishes to see you.�

�The carrier, no doubt,� I thought, and ran downstairs without inquiry.  I was passing the back-parlour or teachers� sitting-room, the door of which was half open, to go to the kitchen, when some one ran out�

�It�s her, I am sure!�I could have told her anywhere!� cried the individual who stopped my progress and took my hand.

I looked: I saw a woman attired like a well-dressed servant, matronly, yet still young; very good-looking, with black hair and eyes, and lively complexion.

�Well, who is it?� she asked, in a voice and with a smile I half recognised; �you�ve not quite forgotten me, I think, Miss Jane?�

In another second I was embracing and kissing her rapturously: �Bessie!  Bessie!  Bessie!� that was all I said; whereat she half laughed, half cried, and we both went into the parlour.  By the fire stood a little fellow of three years old, in plaid frock and trousers.

�That is my little boy,� said Bessie directly.

�Then you are married, Bessie?�

�Yes; nearly five years since to Robert Leaven, the coachman; and I�ve a little girl besides Bobby there, that I�ve christened Jane.�

�And you don�t live at Gateshead?�

�I live at the lodge: the old porter has left.�

�Well, and how do they all get on?  Tell me everything about them, Bessie: but sit down first; and, Bobby, come and sit on my knee, will you?� but Bobby preferred sidling over to his mother.

�You�re not grown so very tall, Miss Jane, nor so very stout,� continued Mrs. Leaven.  �I dare say they�ve not kept you too well at school: Miss Reed is the head and shoulders taller than you are; and Miss Georgiana would make two of you in breadth.�

�Georgiana is handsome, I suppose, Bessie?�

�Very.  She went up to London last winter with her mama, and there everybody admired her, and a young lord fell in love with her: but his relations were against the match; and�what do you think?�he and Miss Georgiana made it up to run away; but they were found out and stopped.  It was Miss Reed that found them out: I believe she was envious; and now she and her sister lead a cat and dog life together; they are always quarrelling��

�Well, and what of John Reed?�

�Oh, he is not doing so well as his mama could wish.  He went to college, and he got�plucked, I think they call it: and then his uncles wanted him to be a barrister, and study the law: but he is such a dissipated young man, they will never make much of him, I think.�

�What does he look like?�

�He is very tall: some people call him a fine-looking young man; but he has such thick lips.�

�And Mrs. Reed?�

�Missis looks stout and well enough in the face, but I think she�s not quite easy in her mind: Mr. John�s conduct does not please her�he spends a deal of money.�

�Did she send you here, Bessie?�

�No, indeed: but I have long wanted to see you, and when I heard that there had been a letter from you, and that you were going to another part of the country, I thought I�d just set off, and get a look at you before you were quite out of my reach.�

�I am afraid you are disappointed in me, Bessie.�  I said this laughing: I perceived that Bessie�s glance, though it expressed regard, did in no shape denote admiration.

�No, Miss Jane, not exactly: you are genteel enough; you look like a lady, and it is as much as ever I expected of you: you were no beauty as a child.�

I smiled at Bessie�s frank answer: I felt that it was correct, but I confess I was not quite indifferent to its import: at eighteen most people wish to please, and the conviction that they have not an exterior likely to second that desire brings anything but gratification.

�I dare say you are clever, though,� continued Bessie, by way of solace.  �What can you do?  Can you play on the piano?�

�A little.�

There was one in the room; Bessie went and opened it, and then asked me to sit down and give her a tune: I played a waltz or two, and she was charmed.

�The Miss Reeds could not play as well!� said she exultingly.  �I always said you would surpass them in learning: and can you draw?�

�That is one of my paintings over the chimney-piece.�  It was a landscape in water colours, of which I had made a present to the superintendent, in acknowledgment of her obliging mediation with the committee on my behalf, and which she had framed and glazed.

�Well, that is beautiful, Miss Jane!  It is as fine a picture as any Miss Reed�s drawing-master could paint, let alone the young ladies themselves, who could not come near it: and have you learnt French?�

�Yes, Bessie, I can both read it and speak it.�

�And you can work on muslin and canvas?�

�I can.�

�Oh, you are quite a lady, Miss Jane!  I knew you would be: you will get on whether your relations notice you or not.  There was something I wanted to ask you.  Have you ever heard anything from your father�s kinsfolk, the Eyres?�

�Never in my life.�

�Well, you know Missis always said they were poor and quite despicable: and they may be poor; but I believe they are as much gentry as the Reeds are; for one day, nearly seven years ago, a Mr. Eyre came to Gateshead and wanted to see you; Missis said you were at school fifty miles off; he seemed so much disappointed, for he could not stay: he was going on a voyage to a foreign country, and the ship was to sail from London in a day or two.  He looked quite a gentleman, and I believe he was your father�s brother.�

�What foreign country was he going to, Bessie?�

�An island thousands of miles off, where they make wine�the butler did tell me��

�Madeira?� I suggested.

�Yes, that is it�that is the very word.�

�So he went?�

�Yes; he did not stay many minutes in the house: Missis was very high with him; she called him afterwards a �sneaking tradesman.�  My Robert believes he was a wine-merchant.�

�Very likely,� I returned; �or perhaps clerk or agent to a wine-merchant.�

Bessie and I conversed about old times an hour longer, and then she was obliged to leave me: I saw her again for a few minutes the next morning at Lowton, while I was waiting for the coach.  We parted finally at the door of the Brocklehurst Arms there: each went her separate way; she set off for the brow of Lowood Fell to meet the conveyance which was to take her back to Gateshead, I mounted the vehicle which was to bear me to new duties and a new life in the unknown environs of Millcote.

CHAPTER XI
A new chapter in a novel is something like a new scene in a play; and when I draw up the curtain this time, reader, you must fancy you see a room in the George Inn at Millcote, with such large figured papering on the walls as inn rooms have; such a carpet, such furniture, such ornaments on the mantelpiece, such prints, including a portrait of George the Third, and another of the Prince of Wales, and a representation of the death of Wolfe.  All this is visible to you by the light of an oil lamp hanging from the ceiling, and by that of an excellent fire, near which I sit in my cloak and bonnet; my muff and umbrella lie on the table, and I am warming away the numbness and chill contracted by sixteen hours� exposure to the rawness of an October day: I left Lowton at four o�clock a.m., and the Millcote town clock is now just striking eight.

Reader, though I look comfortably accommodated, I am not very tranquil in my mind.  I thought when the coach stopped here there would be some one to meet me; I looked anxiously round as I descended the wooden steps the �boots� placed for my convenience, expecting to hear my name pronounced, and to see some description of carriage waiting to convey me to Thornfield.  Nothing of the sort was visible; and when I asked a waiter if any one had been to inquire after a Miss Eyre, I was answered in the negative: so I had no resource but to request to be shown into a private room: and here I am waiting, while all sorts of doubts and fears are troubling my thoughts.

It is a very strange sensation to inexperienced youth to feel itself quite alone in the world, cut adrift from every connection, uncertain whether the port to which it is bound can be reached, and prevented by many impediments from returning to that it has quitted.  The charm of adventure sweetens that sensation, the glow of pride warms it; but then the throb of fear disturbs it; and fear with me became predominant when half-an-hour elapsed and still I was alone.  I bethought myself to ring the bell.

�Is there a place in this neighbourhood called Thornfield?� I asked of the waiter who answered the summons.

�Thornfield?  I don�t know, ma�am; I�ll inquire at the bar.�  He vanished, but reappeared instantly�

�Is your name Eyre, Miss?�

�Yes.�

�Person here waiting for you.�

I jumped up, took my muff and umbrella, and hastened into the inn-passage: a man was standing by the open door, and in the lamp-lit street I dimly saw a one-horse conveyance.

�This will be your luggage, I suppose?� said the man rather abruptly when he saw me, pointing to my trunk in the passage.

�Yes.�  He hoisted it on to the vehicle, which was a sort of car, and then I got in; before he shut me up, I asked him how far it was to Thornfield.

�A matter of six miles.�

�How long shall we be before we get there?�

�Happen an hour and a half.�

He fastened the car door, climbed to his own seat outside, and we set off.  Our progress was leisurely, and gave me ample time to reflect; I was content to be at length so near the end of my journey; and as I leaned back in the comfortable though not elegant conveyance, I meditated much at my ease.

�I suppose,� thought I, �judging from the plainness of the servant and carriage, Mrs. Fairfax is not a very dashing person: so much the better; I never lived amongst fine people but once, and I was very miserable with them.  I wonder if she lives alone except this little girl; if so, and if she is in any degree amiable, I shall surely be able to get on with her; I will do my best; it is a pity that doing one�s best does not always answer.  At Lowood, indeed, I took that resolution, kept it, and succeeded in pleasing; but with Mrs. Reed, I remember my best was always spurned with scorn.  I pray God Mrs. Fairfax may not turn out a second Mrs. Reed; but if she does, I am not bound to stay with her! let the worst come to the worst, I can advertise again.  How far are we on our road now, I wonder?�

I let down the window and looked out; Millcote was behind us; judging by the number of its lights, it seemed a place of considerable magnitude, much larger than Lowton.  We were now, as far as I could see, on a sort of common; but there were houses scattered all over the district; I felt we were in a different region to Lowood, more populous, less picturesque; more stirring, less romantic.

The roads were heavy, the night misty; my conductor let his horse walk all the way, and the hour and a half extended, I verily believe, to two hours; at last he turned in his seat and said�

�You�re noan so far fro� Thornfield now.�

Again I looked out: we were passing a church; I saw its low broad tower against the sky, and its bell was tolling a quarter; I saw a narrow galaxy of lights too, on a hillside, marking a village or hamlet.  About ten minutes after, the driver got down and opened a pair of gates: we passed through, and they clashed to behind us.  We now slowly ascended a drive, and came upon the long front of a house: candlelight gleamed from one curtained bow-window; all the rest were dark.  The car stopped at the front door; it was opened by a maid-servant; I alighted and went in.

�Will you walk this way, ma�am?� said the girl; and I followed her across a square hall with high doors all round: she ushered me into a room whose double illumination of fire and candle at first dazzled me, contrasting as it did with the darkness to which my eyes had been for two hours inured; when I could see, however, a cosy and agreeable picture presented itself to my view.

A snug small room; a round table by a cheerful fire; an arm-chair high-backed and old-fashioned, wherein sat the neatest imaginable little elderly lady, in widow�s cap, black silk gown, and snowy muslin apron; exactly like what I had fancied Mrs. Fairfax, only less stately and milder looking.  She was occupied in knitting; a large cat sat demurely at her feet; nothing in short was wanting to complete the beau-ideal of domestic comfort.  A more reassuring introduction for a new governess could scarcely be conceived; there was no grandeur to overwhelm, no stateliness to embarrass; and then, as I entered, the old lady got up and promptly and kindly came forward to meet me.

�How do you do, my dear?  I am afraid you have had a tedious ride; John drives so slowly; you must be cold, come to the fire.�

�Mrs. Fairfax, I suppose?� said I.

�Yes, you are right: do sit down.�

She conducted me to her own chair, and then began to remove my shawl and untie my bonnet-strings; I begged she would not give herself so much trouble.

�Oh, it is no trouble; I dare say your own hands are almost numbed with cold.  Leah, make a little hot negus and cut a sandwich or two: here are the keys of the storeroom.�

And she produced from her pocket a most housewifely bunch of keys, and delivered them to the servant.

�Now, then, draw nearer to the fire,� she continued.  �You�ve brought your luggage with you, haven�t you, my dear?�

�Yes, ma�am.�

�I�ll see it carried into your room,� she said, and bustled out.

�She treats me like a visitor,� thought I.  �I little expected such a reception; I anticipated only coldness and stiffness: this is not like what I have heard of the treatment of governesses; but I must not exult too soon.�

She returned; with her own hands cleared her knitting apparatus and a book or two from the table, to make room for the tray which Leah now brought, and then herself handed me the refreshments.  I felt rather confused at being the object of more attention than I had ever before received, and, that too, shown by my employer and superior; but as she did not herself seem to consider she was doing anything out of her place, I thought it better to take her civilities quietly.

�Shall I have the pleasure of seeing Miss Fairfax to-night?� I asked, when I had partaken of what she offered me.

�What did you say, my dear?  I am a little deaf,� returned the good lady, approaching her ear to my mouth.

I repeated the question more distinctly.

�Miss Fairfax?  Oh, you mean Miss Varens!  Varens is the name of your future pupil.�

�Indeed!  Then she is not your daughter?�

�No,�I have no family.�

I should have followed up my first inquiry, by asking in what way Miss Varens was connected with her; but I recollected it was not polite to ask too many questions: besides, I was sure to hear in time.

�I am so glad,� she continued, as she sat down opposite to me, and took the cat on her knee; �I am so glad you are come; it will be quite pleasant living here now with a companion.  To be sure it is pleasant at any time; for Thornfield is a fine old hall, rather neglected of late years perhaps, but still it is a respectable place; yet you know in winter-time one feels dreary quite alone in the best quarters.  I say alone�Leah is a nice girl to be sure, and John and his wife are very decent people; but then you see they are only servants, and one can�t converse with them on terms of equality: one must keep them at due distance, for fear of losing one�s authority.  I�m sure last winter (it was a very severe one, if you recollect, and when it did not snow, it rained and blew), not a creature but the butcher and postman came to the house, from November till February; and I really got quite melancholy with sitting night after night alone; I had Leah in to read to me sometimes; but I don�t think the poor girl liked the task much: she felt it confining.  In spring and summer one got on better: sunshine and long days make such a difference; and then, just at the commencement of this autumn, little Adela Varens came and her nurse: a child makes a house alive all at once; and now you are here I shall be quite gay.�

My heart really warmed to the worthy lady as I heard her talk; and I drew my chair a little nearer to her, and expressed my sincere wish that she might find my company as agreeable as she anticipated.

�But I�ll not keep you sitting up late to-night,� said she; �it is on the stroke of twelve now, and you have been travelling all day: you must feel tired.  If you have got your feet well warmed, I�ll show you your bedroom.  I�ve had the room next to mine prepared for you; it is only a small apartment, but I thought you would like it better than one of the large front chambers: to be sure they have finer furniture, but they are so dreary and solitary, I never sleep in them myself.�

I thanked her for her considerate choice, and as I really felt fatigued with my long journey, expressed my readiness to retire.  She took her candle, and I followed her from the room.  First she went to see if the hall-door was fastened; having taken the key from the lock, she led the way upstairs.  The steps and banisters were of oak; the staircase window was high and latticed; both it and the long gallery into which the bedroom doors opened looked as if they belonged to a church rather than a house.  A very chill and vault-like air pervaded the stairs and gallery, suggesting cheerless ideas of space and solitude; and I was glad, when finally ushered into my chamber, to find it of small dimensions, and furnished in ordinary, modern style.

When Mrs. Fairfax had bidden me a kind good-night, and I had fastened my door, gazed leisurely round, and in some measure effaced the eerie impression made by that wide hall, that dark and spacious staircase, and that long, cold gallery, by the livelier aspect of my little room, I remembered that, after a day of bodily fatigue and mental anxiety, I was now at last in safe haven.  The impulse of gratitude swelled my heart, and I knelt down at the bedside, and offered up thanks where thanks were due; not forgetting, ere I rose, to implore aid on my further path, and the power of meriting the kindness which seemed so frankly offered me before it was earned.  My couch had no thorns in it that night; my solitary room no fears.  At once weary and content, I slept soon and soundly: when I awoke it was broad day.

The chamber looked such a bright little place to me as the sun shone in between the gay blue chintz window curtains, showing papered walls and a carpeted floor, so unlike the bare planks and stained plaster of Lowood, that my spirits rose at the view.  Externals have a great effect on the young: I thought that a fairer era of life was beginning for me, one that was to have its flowers and pleasures, as well as its thorns and toils.  My faculties, roused by the change of scene, the new field offered to hope, seemed all astir.  I cannot precisely define what they expected, but it was something pleasant: not perhaps that day or that month, but at an indefinite future period.

I rose; I dressed myself with care: obliged to be plain�for I had no article of attire that was not made with extreme simplicity�I was still by nature solicitous to be neat.  It was not my habit to be disregardful of appearance or careless of the impression I made: on the contrary, I ever wished to look as well as I could, and to please as much as my want of beauty would permit.  I sometimes regretted that I was not handsomer; I sometimes wished to have rosy cheeks, a straight nose, and small cherry mouth; I desired to be tall, stately, and finely developed in figure; I felt it a misfortune that I was so little, so pale, and had features so irregular and so marked.  And why had I these aspirations and these regrets?  It would be difficult to say: I could not then distinctly say it to myself; yet I had a reason, and a logical, natural reason too.  However, when I had brushed my hair very smooth, and put on my black frock�which, Quakerlike as it was, at least had the merit of fitting to a nicety�and adjusted my clean white tucker, I thought I should do respectably enough to appear before Mrs. Fairfax, and that my new pupil would not at least recoil from me with antipathy.  Having opened my chamber window, and seen that I left all things straight and neat on the toilet table, I ventured forth.

Traversing the long and matted gallery, I descended the slippery steps of oak; then I gained the hall: I halted there a minute; I looked at some pictures on the walls (one, I remember, represented a grim man in a cuirass, and one a lady with powdered hair and a pearl necklace), at a bronze lamp pendent from the ceiling, at a great clock whose case was of oak curiously carved, and ebon black with time and rubbing.  Everything appeared very stately and imposing to me; but then I was so little accustomed to grandeur.  The hall-door, which was half of glass, stood open; I stepped over the threshold.  It was a fine autumn morning; the early sun shone serenely on embrowned groves and still green fields; advancing on to the lawn, I looked up and surveyed the front of the mansion.  It was three storeys high, of proportions not vast, though considerable: a gentleman�s manor-house, not a nobleman�s seat: battlements round the top gave it a picturesque look.  Its grey front stood out well from the background of a rookery, whose cawing tenants were now on the wing: they flew over the lawn and grounds to alight in a great meadow, from which these were separated by a sunk fence, and where an array of mighty old thorn trees, strong, knotty, and broad as oaks, at once explained the etymology of the mansion�s designation.  Farther off were hills: not so lofty as those round Lowood, nor so craggy, nor so like barriers of separation from the living world; but yet quiet and lonely hills enough, and seeming to embrace Thornfield with a seclusion I had not expected to find existent so near the stirring locality of Millcote.  A little hamlet, whose roofs were blent with trees, straggled up the side of one of these hills; the church of the district stood nearer Thornfield: its old tower-top looked over a knoll between the house and gates.

I was yet enjoying the calm prospect and pleasant fresh air, yet listening with delight to the cawing of the rooks, yet surveying the wide, hoary front of the hall, and thinking what a great place it was for one lonely little dame like Mrs. Fairfax to inhabit, when that lady appeared at the door.

�What! out already?� said she.  �I see you are an early riser.�  I went up to her, and was received with an affable kiss and shake of the hand.

�How do you like Thornfield?� she asked.  I told her I liked it very much.

�Yes,� she said, �it is a pretty place; but I fear it will be getting out of order, unless Mr. Rochester should take it into his head to come and reside here permanently; or, at least, visit it rather oftener: great houses and fine grounds require the presence of the proprietor.�

�Mr. Rochester!� I exclaimed.  �Who is he?�

�The owner of Thornfield,� she responded quietly.  �Did you not know he was called Rochester?�

Of course I did not�I had never heard of him before; but the old lady seemed to regard his existence as a universally understood fact, with which everybody must be acquainted by instinct.

�I thought,� I continued, �Thornfield belonged to you.�

�To me?  Bless you, child; what an idea!  To me!  I am only the housekeeper�the manager.  To be sure I am distantly related to the Rochesters by the mother�s side, or at least my husband was; he was a clergyman, incumbent of Hay�that little village yonder on the hill�and that church near the gates was his.  The present Mr. Rochester�s mother was a Fairfax, and second cousin to my husband: but I never presume on the connection�in fact, it is nothing to me; I consider myself quite in the light of an ordinary housekeeper: my employer is always civil, and I expect nothing more.�

�And the little girl�my pupil!�

�She is Mr. Rochester�s ward; he commissioned me to find a governess for her.  He intended to have her brought up in ---shire, I believe.  Here she comes, with her �bonne,� as she calls her nurse.�  The enigma then was explained: this affable and kind little widow was no great dame; but a dependant like myself.  I did not like her the worse for that; on the contrary, I felt better pleased than ever.  The equality between her and me was real; not the mere result of condescension on her part: so much the better�my position was all the freer.

As I was meditating on this discovery, a little girl, followed by her attendant, came running up the lawn.  I looked at my pupil, who did not at first appear to notice me: she was quite a child, perhaps seven or eight years old, slightly built, with a pale, small-featured face, and a redundancy of hair falling in curls to her waist.

�Good morning, Miss Adela,� said Mrs. Fairfax.  �Come and speak to the lady who is to teach you, and to make you a clever woman some day.�  She approached.

�C�est la ma gouverante!� said she, pointing to me, and addressing her nurse; who answered�

�Mais oui, certainement.�

�Are they foreigners?� I inquired, amazed at hearing the French language.

�The nurse is a foreigner, and Adela was born on the Continent; and, I believe, never left it till within six months ago.  When she first came here she could speak no English; now she can make shift to talk it a little: I don�t understand her, she mixes it so with French; but you will make out her meaning very well, I dare say.�

Fortunately I had had the advantage of being taught French by a French lady; and as I had always made a point of conversing with Madame Pierrot as often as I could, and had besides, during the last seven years, learnt a portion of French by heart daily�applying myself to take pains with my accent, and imitating as closely as possible the pronunciation of my teacher, I had acquired a certain degree of readiness and correctness in the language, and was not likely to be much at a loss with Mademoiselle Adela.  She came and shook hand with me when she heard that I was her governess; and as I led her in to breakfast, I addressed some phrases to her in her own tongue: she replied briefly at first, but after we were seated at the table, and she had examined me some ten minutes with her large hazel eyes, she suddenly commenced chattering fluently.

�Ah!� cried she, in French, �you speak my language as well as Mr. Rochester does: I can talk to you as I can to him, and so can Sophie.  She will be glad: nobody here understands her: Madame Fairfax is all English.  Sophie is my nurse; she came with me over the sea in a great ship with a chimney that smoked�how it did smoke!�and I was sick, and so was Sophie, and so was Mr. Rochester.  Mr. Rochester lay down on a sofa in a pretty room called the salon, and Sophie and I had little beds in another place.  I nearly fell out of mine; it was like a shelf.  And Mademoiselle�what is your name?�

�Eyre�Jane Eyre.�

�Aire?  Bah!  I cannot say it.  Well, our ship stopped in the morning, before it was quite daylight, at a great city�a huge city, with very dark houses and all smoky; not at all like the pretty clean town I came from; and Mr. Rochester carried me in his arms over a plank to the land, and Sophie came after, and we all got into a coach, which took us to a beautiful large house, larger than this and finer, called an hotel.  We stayed there nearly a week: I and Sophie used to walk every day in a great green place full of trees, called the Park; and there were many children there besides me, and a pond with beautiful birds in it, that I fed with crumbs.�

�Can you understand her when she runs on so fast?� asked Mrs. Fairfax.

I understood her very well, for I had been accustomed to the fluent tongue of Madame Pierrot.

�I wish,� continued the good lady, �you would ask her a question or two about her parents: I wonder if she remembers them?�

�Adele,� I inquired, �with whom did you live when you were in that pretty clean town you spoke of?�

�I lived long ago with mama; but she is gone to the Holy Virgin.  Mama used to teach me to dance and sing, and to say verses.  A great many gentlemen and ladies came to see mama, and I used to dance before them, or to sit on their knees and sing to them: I liked it.  Shall I let you hear me sing now?�

She had finished her breakfast, so I permitted her to give a specimen of her accomplishments.  Descending from her chair, she came and placed herself on my knee; then, folding her little hands demurely before her, shaking back her curls and lifting her eyes to the ceiling, she commenced singing a song from some opera.  It was the strain of a forsaken lady, who, after bewailing the perfidy of her lover, calls pride to her aid; desires her attendant to deck her in her brightest jewels and richest robes, and resolves to meet the false one that night at a ball, and prove to him, by the gaiety of her demeanour, how little his desertion has affected her.

The subject seemed strangely chosen for an infant singer; but I suppose the point of the exhibition lay in hearing the notes of love and jealousy warbled with the lisp of childhood; and in very bad taste that point was: at least I thought so.

Adele sang the canzonette tunefully enough, and with the naivete of her age.  This achieved, she jumped from my knee and said, �Now, Mademoiselle, I will repeat you some poetry.�

Assuming an attitude, she began, �La Ligue des Rats: fable de La Fontaine.�  She then declaimed the little piece with an attention to punctuation and emphasis, a flexibility of voice and an appropriateness of gesture, very unusual indeed at her age, and which proved she had been carefully trained.

�Was it your mama who taught you that piece?� I asked.

�Yes, and she just used to say it in this way: �Qu� avez vous donc? lui dit un de ces rats; parlez!�  She made me lift my hand�so�to remind me to raise my voice at the question.  Now shall I dance for you?�

�No, that will do: but after your mama went to the Holy Virgin, as you say, with whom did you live then?�

�With Madame Frederic and her husband: she took care of me, but she is nothing related to me.  I think she is poor, for she had not so fine a house as mama.  I was not long there.  Mr. Rochester asked me if I would like to go and live with him in England, and I said yes; for I knew Mr. Rochester before I knew Madame Frederic, and he was always kind to me and gave me pretty dresses and toys: but you see he has not kept his word, for he has brought me to England, and now he is gone back again himself, and I never see him.�

After breakfast, Adele and I withdrew to the library, which room, it appears, Mr. Rochester had directed should be used as the schoolroom.  Most of the books were locked up behind glass doors; but there was one bookcase left open containing everything that could be needed in the way of elementary works, and several volumes of light literature, poetry, biography, travels, a few romances, &c.  I suppose he had considered that these were all the governess would require for her private perusal; and, indeed, they contented me amply for the present; compared with the scanty pickings I had now and then been able to glean at Lowood, they seemed to offer an abundant harvest of entertainment and information.  In this room, too, there was a cabinet piano, quite new and of superior tone; also an easel for painting and a pair of globes.

I found my pupil sufficiently docile, though disinclined to apply: she had not been used to regular occupation of any kind.  I felt it would be injudicious to confine her too much at first; so, when I had talked to her a great deal, and got her to learn a little, and when the morning had advanced to noon, I allowed her to return to her nurse.  I then proposed to occupy myself till dinner-time in drawing some little sketches for her use.

As I was going upstairs to fetch my portfolio and pencils, Mrs. Fairfax called to me: �Your morning school-hours are over now, I suppose,� said she.  She was in a room the folding-doors of which stood open: I went in when she addressed me.  It was a large, stately apartment, with purple chairs and curtains, a Turkey carpet, walnut-panelled walls, one vast window rich in slanted glass, and a lofty ceiling, nobly moulded.  Mrs. Fairfax was dusting some vases of fine purple spar, which stood on a sideboard.

�What a beautiful room!� I exclaimed, as I looked round; for I had never before seen any half so imposing.

�Yes; this is the dining-room.  I have just opened the window, to let in a little air and sunshine; for everything gets so damp in apartments that are seldom inhabited; the drawing-room yonder feels like a vault.�

She pointed to a wide arch corresponding to the window, and hung like it with a Tyrian-dyed curtain, now looped up.  Mounting to it by two broad steps, and looking through, I thought I caught a glimpse of a fairy place, so bright to my novice-eyes appeared the view beyond.  Yet it was merely a very pretty drawing-room, and within it a boudoir, both spread with white carpets, on which seemed laid brilliant garlands of flowers; both ceiled with snowy mouldings of white grapes and vine-leaves, beneath which glowed in rich contrast crimson couches and ottomans; while the ornaments on the pale Parian mantelpiece were of sparkling Bohemian glass, ruby red; and between the windows large mirrors repeated the general blending of snow and fire.

�In what order you keep these rooms, Mrs. Fairfax!� said I.  �No dust, no canvas coverings: except that the air feels chilly, one would think they were inhabited daily.�

�Why, Miss Eyre, though Mr. Rochester�s visits here are rare, they are always sudden and unexpected; and as I observed that it put him out to find everything swathed up, and to have a bustle of arrangement on his arrival, I thought it best to keep the rooms in readiness.�

�Is Mr. Rochester an exacting, fastidious sort of man?�

�Not particularly so; but he has a gentleman�s tastes and habits, and he expects to have things managed in conformity to them.�

�Do you like him?  Is he generally liked?�

�Oh, yes; the family have always been respected here.  Almost all the land in this neighbourhood, as far as you can see, has belonged to the Rochesters time out of mind.�

�Well, but, leaving his land out of the question, do you like him?  Is he liked for himself?�

�I have no cause to do otherwise than like him; and I believe he is considered a just and liberal landlord by his tenants: but he has never lived much amongst them.�

�But has he no peculiarities?  What, in short, is his character?�

�Oh! his character is unimpeachable, I suppose.  He is rather peculiar, perhaps: he has travelled a great deal, and seen a great deal of the world, I should think.  I dare say he is clever, but I never had much conversation with him.�

�In what way is he peculiar?�

�I don�t know�it is not easy to describe�nothing striking, but you feel it when he speaks to you; you cannot be always sure whether he is in jest or earnest, whether he is pleased or the contrary; you don�t thoroughly understand him, in short�at least, I don�t: but it is of no consequence, he is a very good master.�

This was all the account I got from Mrs. Fairfax of her employer and mine.  There are people who seem to have no notion of sketching a character, or observing and describing salient points, either in persons or things: the good lady evidently belonged to this class; my queries puzzled, but did not draw her out.  Mr. Rochester was Mr. Rochester in her eyes; a gentleman, a landed proprietor�nothing more: she inquired and searched no further, and evidently wondered at my wish to gain a more definite notion of his identity.

When we left the dining-room, she proposed to show me over the rest of the house; and I followed her upstairs and downstairs, admiring as I went; for all was well arranged and handsome.  The large front chambers I thought especially grand: and some of the third-storey rooms, though dark and low, were interesting from their air of antiquity.  The furniture once appropriated to the lower apartments had from time to time been removed here, as fashions changed: and the imperfect light entering by their narrow casement showed bedsteads of a hundred years old; chests in oak or walnut, looking, with their strange carvings of palm branches and cherubs� heads, like types of the Hebrew ark; rows of venerable chairs, high-backed and narrow; stools still more antiquated, on whose cushioned tops were yet apparent traces of half-effaced embroideries, wrought by fingers that for two generations had been coffin-dust.  All these relics gave to the third storey of Thornfield Hall the aspect of a home of the past: a shrine of memory.  I liked the hush, the gloom, the quaintness of these retreats in the day; but I by no means coveted a night�s repose on one of those wide and heavy beds: shut in, some of them, with doors of oak; shaded, others, with wrought old English hangings crusted with thick work, portraying effigies of strange flowers, and stranger birds, and strangest human beings,�all which would have looked strange, indeed, by the pallid gleam of moonlight.

�Do the servants sleep in these rooms?� I asked.

�No; they occupy a range of smaller apartments to the back; no one ever sleeps here: one would almost say that, if there were a ghost at Thornfield Hall, this would be its haunt.�

�So I think: you have no ghost, then?�

�None that I ever heard of,� returned Mrs. Fairfax, smiling.

�Nor any traditions of one? no legends or ghost stories?�

�I believe not.  And yet it is said the Rochesters have been rather a violent than a quiet race in their time: perhaps, though, that is the reason they rest tranquilly in their graves now.�

�Yes��after life�s fitful fever they sleep well,�� I muttered.  �Where are you going now, Mrs. Fairfax?� for she was moving away.

�On to the leads; will you come and see the view from thence?�  I followed still, up a very narrow staircase to the attics, and thence by a ladder and through a trap-door to the roof of the hall.  I was now on a level with the crow colony, and could see into their nests.  Leaning over the battlements and looking far down, I surveyed the grounds laid out like a map: the bright and velvet lawn closely girdling the grey base of the mansion; the field, wide as a park, dotted with its ancient timber; the wood, dun and sere, divided by a path visibly overgrown, greener with moss than the trees were with foliage; the church at the gates, the road, the tranquil hills, all reposing in the autumn day�s sun; the horizon bounded by a propitious sky, azure, marbled with pearly white.  No feature in the scene was extraordinary, but all was pleasing.  When I turned from it and repassed the trap-door, I could scarcely see my way down the ladder; the attic seemed black as a vault compared with that arch of blue air to which I had been looking up, and to that sunlit scene of grove, pasture, and green hill, of which the hall was the centre, and over which I had been gazing with delight.

Mrs. Fairfax stayed behind a moment to fasten the trap-door; I, by drift of groping, found the outlet from the attic, and proceeded to descend the narrow garret staircase.  I lingered in the long passage to which this led, separating the front and back rooms of the third storey: narrow, low, and dim, with only one little window at the far end, and looking, with its two rows of small black doors all shut, like a corridor in some Bluebeard�s castle.

While I paced softly on, the last sound I expected to hear in so still a region, a laugh, struck my ear.  It was a curious laugh; distinct, formal, mirthless.  I stopped: the sound ceased, only for an instant; it began again, louder: for at first, though distinct, it was very low.  It passed off in a clamorous peal that seemed to wake an echo in every lonely chamber; though it originated but in one, and I could have pointed out the door whence the accents issued.

�Mrs. Fairfax!� I called out: for I now heard her descending the great stairs.  �Did you hear that loud laugh?  Who is it?�

�Some of the servants, very likely,� she answered: �perhaps Grace Poole.�

�Did you hear it?� I again inquired.

�Yes, plainly: I often hear her: she sews in one of these rooms.  Sometimes Leah is with her; they are frequently noisy together.�

The laugh was repeated in its low, syllabic tone, and terminated in an odd murmur.

�Grace!� exclaimed Mrs. Fairfax.

I really did not expect any Grace to answer; for the laugh was as tragic, as preternatural a laugh as any I ever heard; and, but that it was high noon, and that no circumstance of ghostliness accompanied the curious cachinnation; but that neither scene nor season favoured fear, I should have been superstitiously afraid.  However, the event showed me I was a fool for entertaining a sense even of surprise.

The door nearest me opened, and a servant came out,�a woman of between thirty and forty; a set, square-made figure, red-haired, and with a hard, plain face: any apparition less romantic or less ghostly could scarcely be conceived.

�Too much noise, Grace,� said Mrs. Fairfax.  �Remember directions!�  Grace curtseyed silently and went in.

�She is a person we have to sew and assist Leah in her housemaid�s work,� continued the widow; �not altogether unobjectionable in some points, but she does well enough.  By-the-bye, how have you got on with your new pupil this morning?�

The conversation, thus turned on Adele, continued till we reached the light and cheerful region below.  Adele came running to meet us in the hall, exclaiming�

�Mesdames, vous etes servies!� adding, �J�ai bien faim, moi!�

We found dinner ready, and waiting for us in Mrs. Fairfax�s room.

CHAPTER XII
The promise of a smooth career, which my first calm introduction to Thornfield Hall seemed to pledge, was not belied on a longer acquaintance with the place and its inmates.  Mrs. Fairfax turned out to be what she appeared, a placid-tempered, kind-natured woman, of competent education and average intelligence.  My pupil was a lively child, who had been spoilt and indulged, and therefore was sometimes wayward; but as she was committed entirely to my care, and no injudicious interference from any quarter ever thwarted my plans for her improvement, she soon forgot her little freaks, and became obedient and teachable.  She had no great talents, no marked traits of character, no peculiar development of feeling or taste which raised her one inch above the ordinary level of childhood; but neither had she any deficiency or vice which sunk her below it.  She made reasonable progress, entertained for me a vivacious, though perhaps not very profound, affection; and by her simplicity, gay prattle, and efforts to please, inspired me, in return, with a degree of attachment sufficient to make us both content in each other�s society.

This, par parenthese, will be thought cool language by persons who entertain solemn doctrines about the angelic nature of children, and the duty of those charged with their education to conceive for them an idolatrous devotion: but I am not writing to flatter parental egotism, to echo cant, or prop up humbug; I am merely telling the truth.  I felt a conscientious solicitude for Adele�s welfare and progress, and a quiet liking for her little self: just as I cherished towards Mrs. Fairfax a thankfulness for her kindness, and a pleasure in her society proportionate to the tranquil regard she had for me, and the moderation of her mind and character.

Anybody may blame me who likes, when I add further, that, now and then, when I took a walk by myself in the grounds; when I went down to the gates and looked through them along the road; or when, while Adele played with her nurse, and Mrs. Fairfax made jellies in the storeroom, I climbed the three staircases, raised the trap-door of the attic, and having reached the leads, looked out afar over sequestered field and hill, and along dim sky-line�that then I longed for a power of vision which might overpass that limit; which might reach the busy world, towns, regions full of life I had heard of but never seen�that then I desired more of practical experience than I possessed; more of intercourse with my kind, of acquaintance with variety of character, than was here within my reach.  I valued what was good in Mrs. Fairfax, and what was good in Adele; but I believed in the existence of other and more vivid kinds of goodness, and what I believed in I wished to behold.

Who blames me?  Many, no doubt; and I shall be called discontented.  I could not help it: the restlessness was in my nature; it agitated me to pain sometimes.  Then my sole relief was to walk along the corridor of the third storey, backwards and forwards, safe in the silence and solitude of the spot, and allow my mind�s eye to dwell on whatever bright visions rose before it�and, certainly, they were many and glowing; to let my heart be heaved by the exultant movement, which, while it swelled it in trouble, expanded it with life; and, best of all, to open my inward ear to a tale that was never ended�a tale my imagination created, and narrated continuously; quickened with all of incident, life, fire, feeling, that I desired and had not in my actual existence. 

It is in vain to say human beings ought to be satisfied with tranquillity: they must have action; and they will make it if they cannot find it.  Millions are condemned to a stiller doom than mine, and millions are in silent revolt against their lot.  Nobody knows how many rebellions besides political rebellions ferment in the masses of life which people earth.  Women are supposed to be very calm generally: but women feel just as men feel; they need exercise for their faculties, and a field for their efforts, as much as their brothers do; they suffer from too rigid a restraint, too absolute a stagnation, precisely as men would suffer; and it is narrow-minded in their more privileged fellow-creatures to say that they ought to confine themselves to making puddings and knitting stockings, to playing on the piano and embroidering bags.  It is thoughtless to condemn them, or laugh at them, if they seek to do more or learn more than custom has pronounced necessary for their sex.

When thus alone, I not unfrequently heard Grace Poole�s laugh: the same peal, the same low, slow ha! ha! which, when first heard, had thrilled me: I heard, too, her eccentric murmurs; stranger than her laugh.  There were days when she was quite silent; but there were others when I could not account for the sounds she made.  Sometimes I saw her: she would come out of her room with a basin, or a plate, or a tray in her hand, go down to the kitchen and shortly return, generally (oh, romantic reader, forgive me for telling the plain truth!) bearing a pot of porter.  Her appearance always acted as a damper to the curiosity raised by her oral oddities: hard-featured and staid, she had no point to which interest could attach.  I made some attempts to draw her into conversation, but she seemed a person of few words: a monosyllabic reply usually cut short every effort of that sort.

The other members of the household, viz., John and his wife, Leah the housemaid, and Sophie the French nurse, were decent people; but in no respect remarkable; with Sophie I used to talk French, and sometimes I asked her questions about her native country; but she was not of a descriptive or narrative turn, and generally gave such vapid and confused answers as were calculated rather to check than encourage inquiry.

October, November, December passed away.  One afternoon in January, Mrs. Fairfax had begged a holiday for Adele, because she had a cold; and, as Adele seconded the request with an ardour that reminded me how precious occasional holidays had been to me in my own childhood, I accorded it, deeming that I did well in showing pliability on the point.  It was a fine, calm day, though very cold; I was tired of sitting still in the library through a whole long morning: Mrs. Fairfax had just written a letter which was waiting to be posted, so I put on my bonnet and cloak and volunteered to carry it to Hay; the distance, two miles, would be a pleasant winter afternoon walk.  Having seen Adele comfortably seated in her little chair by Mrs. Fairfax�s parlour fireside, and given her her best wax doll (which I usually kept enveloped in silver paper in a drawer) to play with, and a story-book for change of amusement; and having replied to her �Revenez bientot, ma bonne amie, ma chere Mdlle. Jeannette,� with a kiss I set out.

The ground was hard, the air was still, my road was lonely; I walked fast till I got warm, and then I walked slowly to enjoy and analyse the species of pleasure brooding for me in the hour and situation.  It was three o�clock; the church bell tolled as I passed under the belfry: the charm of the hour lay in its approaching dimness, in the low-gliding and pale-beaming sun.  I was a mile from Thornfield, in a lane noted for wild roses in summer, for nuts and blackberries in autumn, and even now possessing a few coral treasures in hips and haws, but whose best winter delight lay in its utter solitude and leafless repose.  If a breath of air stirred, it made no sound here; for there was not a holly, not an evergreen to rustle, and the stripped hawthorn and hazel bushes were as still as the white, worn stones which causewayed the middle of the path.  Far and wide, on each side, there were only fields, where no cattle now browsed; and the little brown birds, which stirred occasionally in the hedge, looked like single russet leaves that had forgotten to drop.

This lane inclined up-hill all the way to Hay; having reached the middle, I sat down on a stile which led thence into a field.  Gathering my mantle about me, and sheltering my hands in my muff, I did not feel the cold, though it froze keenly; as was attested by a sheet of ice covering the causeway, where a little brooklet, now congealed, had overflowed after a rapid thaw some days since.  From my seat I could look down on Thornfield: the grey and battlemented hall was the principal object in the vale below me; its woods and dark rookery rose against the west.  I lingered till the sun went down amongst the trees, and sank crimson and clear behind them.  I then turned eastward.

On the hill-top above me sat the rising moon; pale yet as a cloud, but brightening momentarily, she looked over Hay, which, half lost in trees, sent up a blue smoke from its few chimneys: it was yet a mile distant, but in the absolute hush I could hear plainly its thin murmurs of life.  My ear, too, felt the flow of currents; in what dales and depths I could not tell: but there were many hills beyond Hay, and doubtless many becks threading their passes.  That evening calm betrayed alike the tinkle of the nearest streams, the sough of the most remote.

A rude noise broke on these fine ripplings and whisperings, at once so far away and so clear: a positive tramp, tramp, a metallic clatter, which effaced the soft wave-wanderings; as, in a picture, the solid mass of a crag, or the rough boles of a great oak, drawn in dark and strong on the foreground, efface the aerial distance of azure hill, sunny horizon, and blended clouds where tint melts into tint.

The din was on the causeway: a horse was coming; the windings of the lane yet hid it, but it approached.  I was just leaving the stile; yet, as the path was narrow, I sat still to let it go by.  In those days I was young, and all sorts of fancies bright and dark tenanted my mind: the memories of nursery stories were there amongst other rubbish; and when they recurred, maturing youth added to them a vigour and vividness beyond what childhood could give.  As this horse approached, and as I watched for it to appear through the dusk, I remembered certain of Bessie�s tales, wherein figured a North-of-England spirit called a �Gytrash,� which, in the form of horse, mule, or large dog, haunted solitary ways, and sometimes came upon belated travellers, as this horse was now coming upon me.

It was very near, but not yet in sight; when, in addition to the tramp, tramp, I heard a rush under the hedge, and close down by the hazel stems glided a great dog, whose black and white colour made him a distinct object against the trees.  It was exactly one form of Bessie�s Gytrash�a lion-like creature with long hair and a huge head: it passed me, however, quietly enough; not staying to look up, with strange pretercanine eyes, in my face, as I half expected it would.  The horse followed,�a tall steed, and on its back a rider.  The man, the human being, broke the spell at once.  Nothing ever rode the Gytrash: it was always alone; and goblins, to my notions, though they might tenant the dumb carcasses of beasts, could scarce covet shelter in the commonplace human form.  No Gytrash was this,�only a traveller taking the short cut to Millcote.  He passed, and I went on; a few steps, and I turned: a sliding sound and an exclamation of �What the deuce is to do now?� and a clattering tumble, arrested my attention.  Man and horse were down; they had slipped on the sheet of ice which glazed the causeway.  The dog came bounding back, and seeing his master in a predicament, and hearing the horse groan, barked till the evening hills echoed the sound, which was deep in proportion to his magnitude.  He snuffed round the prostrate group, and then he ran up to me; it was all he could do,�there was no other help at hand to summon.  I obeyed him, and walked down to the traveller, by this time struggling himself free of his steed.  His efforts were so vigorous, I thought he could not be much hurt; but I asked him the question�

�Are you injured, sir?�

I think he was swearing, but am not certain; however, he was pronouncing some formula which prevented him from replying to me directly.

�Can I do anything?� I asked again.

�You must just stand on one side,� he answered as he rose, first to his knees, and then to his feet.  I did; whereupon began a heaving, stamping, clattering process, accompanied by a barking and baying which removed me effectually some yards� distance; but I would not be driven quite away till I saw the event.  This was finally fortunate; the horse was re-established, and the dog was silenced with a �Down, Pilot!�  The traveller now, stooping, felt his foot and leg, as if trying whether they were sound; apparently something ailed them, for he halted to the stile whence I had just risen, and sat down.

I was in the mood for being useful, or at least officious, I think, for I now drew near him again.

�If you are hurt, and want help, sir, I can fetch some one either from Thornfield Hall or from Hay.�

�Thank you: I shall do: I have no broken bones,�only a sprain;� and again he stood up and tried his foot, but the result extorted an involuntary �Ugh!�

Something of daylight still lingered, and the moon was waxing bright: I could see him plainly.  His figure was enveloped in a riding cloak, fur collared and steel clasped; its details were not apparent, but I traced the general points of middle height and considerable breadth of chest.  He had a dark face, with stern features and a heavy brow; his eyes and gathered eyebrows looked ireful and thwarted just now; he was past youth, but had not reached middle-age; perhaps he might be thirty-five.  I felt no fear of him, and but little shyness.  Had he been a handsome, heroic-looking young gentleman, I should not have dared to stand thus questioning him against his will, and offering my services unasked.  I had hardly ever seen a handsome youth; never in my life spoken to one.  I had a theoretical reverence and homage for beauty, elegance, gallantry, fascination; but had I met those qualities incarnate in masculine shape, I should have known instinctively that they neither had nor could have sympathy with anything in me, and should have shunned them as one would fire, lightning, or anything else that is bright but antipathetic.

If even this stranger had smiled and been good-humoured to me when I addressed him; if he had put off my offer of assistance gaily and with thanks, I should have gone on my way and not felt any vocation to renew inquiries: but the frown, the roughness of the traveller, set me at my ease: I retained my station when he waved to me to go, and announced�

�I cannot think of leaving you, sir, at so late an hour, in this solitary lane, till I see you are fit to mount your horse.�

He looked at me when I said this; he had hardly turned his eyes in my direction before.

�I should think you ought to be at home yourself,� said he, �if you have a home in this neighbourhood: where do you come from?�

�From just below; and I am not at all afraid of being out late when it is moonlight: I will run over to Hay for you with pleasure, if you wish it: indeed, I am going there to post a letter.�

�You live just below�do you mean at that house with the battlements?� pointing to Thornfield Hall, on which the moon cast a hoary gleam, bringing it out distinct and pale from the woods that, by contrast with the western sky, now seemed one mass of shadow.

�Yes, sir.�

�Whose house is it?�

�Mr. Rochester�s.�

�Do you know Mr. Rochester?�

�No, I have never seen him.�

�He is not resident, then?�

�No.�

�Can you tell me where he is?�

�I cannot.�

�You are not a servant at the hall, of course.  You are��  He stopped, ran his eye over my dress, which, as usual, was quite simple: a black merino cloak, a black beaver bonnet; neither of them half fine enough for a lady�s-maid.  He seemed puzzled to decide what I was; I helped him.

�I am the governess.�

�Ah, the governess!� he repeated; �deuce take me, if I had not forgotten!  The governess!� and again my raiment underwent scrutiny.  In two minutes he rose from the stile: his face expressed pain when he tried to move.

�I cannot commission you to fetch help,� he said; �but you may help me a little yourself, if you will be so kind.�

�Yes, sir.�

�You have not an umbrella that I can use as a stick?�

�No.�

�Try to get hold of my horse�s bridle and lead him to me: you are not afraid?�

I should have been afraid to touch a horse when alone, but when told to do it, I was disposed to obey.  I put down my muff on the stile, and went up to the tall steed; I endeavoured to catch the bridle, but it was a spirited thing, and would not let me come near its head; I made effort on effort, though in vain: meantime, I was mortally afraid of its trampling fore-feet.  The traveller waited and watched for some time, and at last he laughed.

 

�I see,� he said, �the mountain will never be brought to Mahomet, so all you can do is to aid Mahomet to go to the mountain; I must beg of you to come here.�

I came.  �Excuse me,� he continued: �necessity compels me to make you useful.�  He laid a heavy hand on my shoulder, and leaning on me with some stress, limped to his horse.  Having once caught the bridle, he mastered it directly and sprang to his saddle; grimacing grimly as he made the effort, for it wrenched his sprain.

�Now,� said he, releasing his under lip from a hard bite, �just hand me my whip; it lies there under the hedge.�

I sought it and found it.

�Thank you; now make haste with the letter to Hay, and return as fast as you can.�

A touch of a spurred heel made his horse first start and rear, and then bound away; the dog rushed in his traces; all three vanished,

�Like heath that, in the wilderness,
The wild wind whirls away.�

I took up my muff and walked on.  The incident had occurred and was gone for me: it was an incident of no moment, no romance, no interest in a sense; yet it marked with change one single hour of a monotonous life.  My help had been needed and claimed; I had given it: I was pleased to have done something; trivial, transitory though the deed was, it was yet an active thing, and I was weary of an existence all passive.  The new face, too, was like a new picture introduced to the gallery of memory; and it was dissimilar to all the others hanging there: firstly, because it was masculine; and, secondly, because it was dark, strong, and stern.  I had it still before me when I entered Hay, and slipped the letter into the post-office; I saw it as I walked fast down-hill all the way home.  When I came to the stile, I stopped a minute, looked round and listened, with an idea that a horse�s hoofs might ring on the causeway again, and that a rider in a cloak, and a Gytrash-like Newfoundland dog, might be again apparent: I saw only the hedge and a pollard willow before me, rising up still and straight to meet the moonbeams; I heard only the faintest waft of wind roaming fitful among the trees round Thornfield, a mile distant; and when I glanced down in the direction of the murmur, my eye, traversing the hall-front, caught a light kindling in a window: it reminded me that I was late, and I hurried on.

I did not like re-entering Thornfield.  To pass its threshold was to return to stagnation; to cross the silent hall, to ascend the darksome staircase, to seek my own lonely little room, and then to meet tranquil Mrs. Fairfax, and spend the long winter evening with her, and her only, was to quell wholly the faint excitement wakened by my walk,�to slip again over my faculties the viewless fetters of an uniform and too still existence; of an existence whose very privileges of security and ease I was becoming incapable of appreciating.  What good it would have done me at that time to have been tossed in the storms of an uncertain struggling life, and to have been taught by rough and bitter experience to long for the calm amidst which I now repined!  Yes, just as much good as it would do a man tired of sitting still in a �too easy chair� to take a long walk: and just as natural was the wish to stir, under my circumstances, as it would be under his.

I lingered at the gates; I lingered on the lawn; I paced backwards and forwards on the pavement; the shutters of the glass door were closed; I could not see into the interior; and both my eyes and spirit seemed drawn from the gloomy house�from the grey-hollow filled with rayless cells, as it appeared to me�to that sky expanded before me,�a blue sea absolved from taint of cloud; the moon ascending it in solemn march; her orb seeming to look up as she left the hill-tops, from behind which she had come, far and farther below her, and aspired to the zenith, midnight dark in its fathomless depth and measureless distance; and for those trembling stars that followed her course; they made my heart tremble, my veins glow when I viewed them.  Little things recall us to earth; the clock struck in the hall; that sufficed; I turned from moon and stars, opened a side-door, and went in.

The hall was not dark, nor yet was it lit, only by the high-hung bronze lamp; a warm glow suffused both it and the lower steps of the oak staircase.  This ruddy shine issued from the great dining-room, whose two-leaved door stood open, and showed a genial fire in the grate, glancing on marble hearth and brass fire-irons, and revealing purple draperies and polished furniture, in the most pleasant radiance.  It revealed, too, a group near the mantelpiece: I had scarcely caught it, and scarcely become aware of a cheerful mingling of voices, amongst which I seemed to distinguish the tones of Adele, when the door closed.

I hastened to Mrs. Fairfax�s room; there was a fire there too, but no candle, and no Mrs. Fairfax.  Instead, all alone, sitting upright on the rug, and gazing with gravity at the blaze, I beheld a great black and white long-haired dog, just like the Gytrash of the lane.  It was so like it that I went forward and said��Pilot� and the thing got up and came to me and snuffed me.  I caressed him, and he wagged his great tail; but he looked an eerie creature to be alone with, and I could not tell whence he had come.  I rang the bell, for I wanted a candle; and I wanted, too, to get an account of this visitant.  Leah entered.

�What dog is this?�

�He came with master.�

�With whom?�

�With master�Mr. Rochester�he is just arrived.�

�Indeed! and is Mrs. Fairfax with him?�

�Yes, and Miss Adele; they are in the dining-room, and John is gone for a surgeon; for master has had an accident; his horse fell and his ankle is sprained.�

�Did the horse fall in Hay Lane?�

�Yes, coming down-hill; it slipped on some ice.�

�Ah!  Bring me a candle will you Leah?�

Leah brought it; she entered, followed by Mrs. Fairfax, who repeated the news; adding that Mr. Carter the surgeon was come, and was now with Mr. Rochester: then she hurried out to give orders about tea, and I went upstairs to take off my things.

CHAPTER XIII
Mr. Rochester, it seems, by the surgeon�s orders, went to bed early that night; nor did he rise soon next morning.  When he did come down, it was to attend to business: his agent and some of his tenants were arrived, and waiting to speak with him.

Adele and I had now to vacate the library: it would be in daily requisition as a reception-room for callers.  A fire was lit in an apartment upstairs, and there I carried our books, and arranged it for the future schoolroom.  I discerned in the course of the morning that Thornfield Hall was a changed place: no longer silent as a church, it echoed every hour or two to a knock at the door, or a clang of the bell; steps, too, often traversed the hall, and new voices spoke in different keys below; a rill from the outer world was flowing through it; it had a master: for my part, I liked it better.

Adele was not easy to teach that day; she could not apply: she kept running to the door and looking over the banisters to see if she could get a glimpse of Mr. Rochester; then she coined pretexts to go downstairs, in order, as I shrewdly suspected, to visit the library, where I knew she was not wanted; then, when I got a little angry, and made her sit still, she continued to talk incessantly of her �ami, Monsieur Edouard Fairfax de Rochester,� as she dubbed him (I had not before heard his prenomens), and to conjecture what presents he had brought her: for it appears he had intimated the night before, that when his luggage came from Millcote, there would be found amongst it a little box in whose contents she had an interest.

�Et cela doit signifier,� said she, �qu�il y aura la dedans un cadeau pour moi, et peut-etre pour vous aussi, mademoiselle.  Monsieur a parle de vous: il m�a demande le nom de ma gouvernante, et si elle n�etait pas une petite personne, assez mince et un peu pale.  J�ai dit qu�oui: car c�est vrai, n�est-ce pas, mademoiselle?�

I and my pupil dined as usual in Mrs. Fairfax�s parlour; the afternoon was wild and snowy, and we passed it in the schoolroom.  At dark I allowed Adele to put away books and work, and to run downstairs; for, from the comparative silence below, and from the cessation of appeals to the door-bell, I conjectured that Mr. Rochester was now at liberty.  Left alone, I walked to the window; but nothing was to be seen thence: twilight and snowflakes together thickened the air, and hid the very shrubs on the lawn.  I let down the curtain and went back to the fireside.

In the clear embers I was tracing a view, not unlike a picture I remembered to have seen of the castle of Heidelberg, on the Rhine, when Mrs. Fairfax came in, breaking up by her entrance the fiery mosaic I had been piercing together, and scattering too some heavy unwelcome thoughts that were beginning to throng on my solitude.

�Mr. Rochester would be glad if you and your pupil would take tea with him in the drawing-room this evening,� said she: �he has been so much engaged all day that he could not ask to see you before.�

�When is his tea-time?� I inquired.

�Oh, at six o�clock: he keeps early hours in the country.  You had better change your frock now; I will go with you and fasten it.  Here is a candle.�

�Is it necessary to change my frock?�

�Yes, you had better: I always dress for the evening when Mr. Rochester is here.�

This additional ceremony seemed somewhat stately; however, I repaired to my room, and, with Mrs. Fairfax�s aid, replaced my black stuff dress by one of black silk; the best and the only additional one I had, except one of light grey, which, in my Lowood notions of the toilette, I thought too fine to be worn, except on first-rate occasions.

�You want a brooch,� said Mrs. Fairfax.  I had a single little pearl ornament which Miss Temple gave me as a parting keepsake: I put it on, and then we went downstairs.  Unused as I was to strangers, it was rather a trial to appear thus formally summoned in Mr. Rochester�s presence.  I let Mrs. Fairfax precede me into the dining-room, and kept in her shade as we crossed that apartment; and, passing the arch, whose curtain was now dropped, entered the elegant recess beyond.

Two wax candles stood lighted on the table, and two on the mantelpiece; basking in the light and heat of a superb fire, lay Pilot�Adele knelt near him.  Half reclined on a couch appeared Mr. Rochester, his foot supported by the cushion; he was looking at Adele and the dog: the fire shone full on his face.  I knew my traveller with his broad and jetty eyebrows; his square forehead, made squarer by the horizontal sweep of his black hair.  I recognised his decisive nose, more remarkable for character than beauty; his full nostrils, denoting, I thought, choler; his grim mouth, chin, and jaw�yes, all three were very grim, and no mistake.  His shape, now divested of cloak, I perceived harmonised in squareness with his physiognomy: I suppose it was a good figure in the athletic sense of the term�broad chested and thin flanked, though neither tall nor graceful.

Mr. Rochester must have been aware of the entrance of Mrs. Fairfax and myself; but it appeared he was not in the mood to notice us, for he never lifted his head as we approached.

�Here is Miss Eyre, sir,� said Mrs. Fairfax, in her quiet way.  He bowed, still not taking his eyes from the group of the dog and child.

�Let Miss Eyre be seated,� said he: and there was something in the forced stiff bow, in the impatient yet formal tone, which seemed further to express, �What the deuce is it to me whether Miss Eyre be there or not?  At this moment I am not disposed to accost her.�

I sat down quite disembarrassed.  A reception of finished politeness would probably have confused me: I could not have returned or repaid it by answering grace and elegance on my part; but harsh caprice laid me under no obligation; on the contrary, a decent quiescence, under the freak of manner, gave me the advantage.  Besides, the eccentricity of the proceeding was piquant: I felt interested to see how he would go on.

He went on as a statue would, that is, he neither spoke nor moved.  Mrs. Fairfax seemed to think it necessary that some one should be amiable, and she began to talk.  Kindly, as usual�and, as usual, rather trite�she condoled with him on the pressure of business he had had all day; on the annoyance it must have been to him with that painful sprain: then she commended his patience and perseverance in going through with it.

�Madam, I should like some tea,� was the sole rejoinder she got.  She hastened to ring the bell; and when the tray came, she proceeded to arrange the cups, spoons, &c., with assiduous celerity.  I and Adele went to the table; but the master did not leave his couch.

�Will you hand Mr. Rochester�s cup?� said Mrs. Fairfax to me; �Adele might perhaps spill it.�

I did as requested.  As he took the cup from my hand, Adele, thinking the moment propitious for making a request in my favour, cried out�

�N�est-ce pas, monsieur, qu�il y a un cadeau pour Mademoiselle Eyre dans votre petit coffre?�

�Who talks of cadeaux?� said he gruffly.  �Did you expect a present, Miss Eyre?  Are you fond of presents?� and he searched my face with eyes that I saw were dark, irate, and piercing.

�I hardly know, sir; I have little experience of them: they are generally thought pleasant things.�

�Generally thought?  But what do you think?�

�I should be obliged to take time, sir, before I could give you an answer worthy of your acceptance: a present has many faces to it, has it not? and one should consider all, before pronouncing an opinion as to its nature.�

�Miss Eyre, you are not so unsophisticated as Adele: she demands a �cadeau,� clamorously, the moment she sees me: you beat about the bush.�

�Because I have less confidence in my deserts than Adele has: she can prefer the claim of old acquaintance, and the right too of custom; for she says you have always been in the habit of giving her playthings; but if I had to make out a case I should be puzzled, since I am a stranger, and have done nothing to entitle me to an acknowledgment.�

�Oh, don�t fall back on over-modesty!  I have examined Adele, and find you have taken great pains with her: she is not bright, she has no talents; yet in a short time she has made much improvement.�

�Sir, you have now given me my �cadeau;� I am obliged to you: it is the meed teachers most covet�praise of their pupils� progress.�

�Humph!� said Mr. Rochester, and he took his tea in silence.

�Come to the fire,� said the master, when the tray was taken away, and Mrs. Fairfax had settled into a corner with her knitting; while Adele was leading me by the hand round the room, showing me the beautiful books and ornaments on the consoles and chiffonnieres.  We obeyed, as in duty bound; Adele wanted to take a seat on my knee, but she was ordered to amuse herself with Pilot.

�You have been resident in my house three months?�

�Yes, sir.�

�And you came from�?�

�From Lowood school, in ---shire.�

�Ah! a charitable concern.  How long were you there?�

�Eight years.�

�Eight years! you must be tenacious of life.  I thought half the time in such a place would have done up any constitution!  No wonder you have rather the look of another world.  I marvelled where you had got that sort of face.  When you came on me in Hay Lane last night, I thought unaccountably of fairy tales, and had half a mind to demand whether you had bewitched my horse: I am not sure yet.  Who are your parents?�

�I have none.�

�Nor ever had, I suppose: do you remember them?�

�No.�

�I thought not.  And so you were waiting for your people when you sat on that stile?�

�For whom, sir?�

�For the men in green: it was a proper moonlight evening for them.  Did I break through one of your rings, that you spread that damned ice on the causeway?�

I shook my head.  �The men in green all forsook England a hundred years ago,� said I, speaking as seriously as he had done.  �And not even in Hay Lane, or the fields about it, could you find a trace of them.  I don�t think either summer or harvest, or winter moon, will ever shine on their revels more.�

Mrs. Fairfax had dropped her knitting, and, with raised eyebrows, seemed wondering what sort of talk this was.

�Well,� resumed Mr. Rochester, �if you disown parents, you must have some sort of kinsfolk: uncles and aunts?�

�No; none that I ever saw.�

�And your home?�

�I have none.�

�Where do your brothers and sisters live?�

�I have no brothers or sisters.�

�Who recommended you to come here?�

�I advertised, and Mrs. Fairfax answered my advertisement.�

�Yes,� said the good lady, who now knew what ground we were upon, �and I am daily thankful for the choice Providence led me to make.  Miss Eyre has been an invaluable companion to me, and a kind and careful teacher to Adele.�

�Don�t trouble yourself to give her a character,� returned Mr. Rochester: �eulogiums will not bias me; I shall judge for myself.  She began by felling my horse.�

�Sir?� said Mrs. Fairfax.

�I have to thank her for this sprain.�

The widow looked bewildered.

�Miss Eyre, have you ever lived in a town?�

�No, sir.�

�Have you seen much society?�

�None but the pupils and teachers of Lowood, and now the inmates of Thornfield.�

�Have you read much?�

�Only such books as came in my way; and they have not been numerous or very learned.�

�You have lived the life of a nun: no doubt you are well drilled in religious forms;�Brocklehurst, who I understand directs Lowood, is a parson, is he not?�

�Yes, sir.�

�And you girls probably worshipped him, as a convent full of religieuses would worship their director.�

�Oh, no.�

�You are very cool!  No!  What! a novice not worship her priest!  That sounds blasphemous.�

�I disliked Mr. Brocklehurst; and I was not alone in the feeling.  He is a harsh man; at once pompous and meddling; he cut off our hair; and for economy�s sake bought us bad needles and thread, with which we could hardly sew.�

�That was very false economy,� remarked Mrs. Fairfax, who now again caught the drift of the dialogue.

�And was that the head and front of his offending?� demanded Mr. Rochester.

�He starved us when he had the sole superintendence of the provision department, before the committee was appointed; and he bored us with long lectures once a week, and with evening readings from books of his own inditing, about sudden deaths and judgments, which made us afraid to go to bed.�

�What age were you when you went to Lowood?�

�About ten.�

�And you stayed there eight years: you are now, then, eighteen?�

I assented.

�Arithmetic, you see, is useful; without its aid, I should hardly have been able to guess your age.  It is a point difficult to fix where the features and countenance are so much at variance as in your case.  And now what did you learn at Lowood?  Can you play?�

�A little.�

�Of course: that is the established answer.  Go into the library�I mean, if you please.�(Excuse my tone of command; I am used to say, �Do this,� and it is done: I cannot alter my customary habits for one new inmate.)�Go, then, into the library; take a candle with you; leave the door open; sit down to the piano, and play a tune.�

I departed, obeying his directions.

�Enough!� he called out in a few minutes.  �You play a little, I see; like any other English school-girl; perhaps rather better than some, but not well.�

I closed the piano and returned.  Mr. Rochester continued��Adele showed me some sketches this morning, which she said were yours.  I don�t know whether they were entirely of your doing; probably a master aided you?�

�No, indeed!� I interjected.

�Ah! that pricks pride.  Well, fetch me your portfolio, if you can vouch for its contents being original; but don�t pass your word unless you are certain: I can recognise patchwork.�

�Then I will say nothing, and you shall judge for yourself, sir.�

I brought the portfolio from the library.

�Approach the table,� said he; and I wheeled it to his couch.  Adele and Mrs. Fairfax drew near to see the pictures.

�No crowding,� said Mr. Rochester: �take the drawings from my hand as I finish with them; but don�t push your faces up to mine.�

He deliberately scrutinised each sketch and painting.  Three he laid aside; the others, when he had examined them, he swept from him.

�Take them off to the other table, Mrs. Fairfax,� said he, �and look at them with Adele;�you� (glancing at me) �resume your seat, and answer my questions.  I perceive those pictures were done by one hand: was that hand yours?�

�Yes.�

�And when did you find time to do them?  They have taken much time, and some thought.�

�I did them in the last two vacations I spent at Lowood, when I had no other occupation.�

�Where did you get your copies?�

�Out of my head.�

�That head I see now on your shoulders?�

�Yes, sir.�

�Has it other furniture of the same kind within?�

�I should think it may have: I should hope�better.�

He spread the pictures before him, and again surveyed them alternately.

While he is so occupied, I will tell you, reader, what they are: and first, I must premise that they are nothing wonderful.  The subjects had, indeed, risen vividly on my mind.  As I saw them with the spiritual eye, before I attempted to embody them, they were striking; but my hand would not second my fancy, and in each case it had wrought out but a pale portrait of the thing I had conceived.

These pictures were in water-colours.  The first represented clouds low and livid, rolling over a swollen sea: all the distance was in eclipse; so, too, was the foreground; or rather, the nearest billows, for there was no land.  One gleam of light lifted into relief a half-submerged mast, on which sat a cormorant, dark and large, with wings flecked with foam; its beak held a gold bracelet set with gems, that I had touched with as brilliant tints as my palette could yield, and as glittering distinctness as my pencil could impart.  Sinking below the bird and mast, a drowned corpse glanced through the green water; a fair arm was the only limb clearly visible, whence the bracelet had been washed or torn.

The second picture contained for foreground only the dim peak of a hill, with grass and some leaves slanting as if by a breeze.  Beyond and above spread an expanse of sky, dark blue as at twilight: rising into the sky was a woman�s shape to the bust, portrayed in tints as dusk and soft as I could combine.  The dim forehead was crowned with a star; the lineaments below were seen as through the suffusion of vapour; the eyes shone dark and wild; the hair streamed shadowy, like a beamless cloud torn by storm or by electric travail.  On the neck lay a pale reflection like moonlight; the same faint lustre touched the train of thin clouds from which rose and bowed this vision of the Evening Star.

The third showed the pinnacle of an iceberg piercing a polar winter sky: a muster of northern lights reared their dim lances, close serried, along the horizon.  Throwing these into distance, rose, in the foreground, a head,�a colossal head, inclined towards the iceberg, and resting against it.  Two thin hands, joined under the forehead, and supporting it, drew up before the lower features a sable veil, a brow quite bloodless, white as bone, and an eye hollow and fixed, blank of meaning but for the glassiness of despair, alone were visible.  Above the temples, amidst wreathed turban folds of black drapery, vague in its character and consistency as cloud, gleamed a ring of white flame, gemmed with sparkles of a more lurid tinge.  This pale crescent was �the likeness of a kingly crown;� what it diademed was �the shape which shape had none.�

�Were you happy when you painted these pictures?� asked Mr. Rochester presently.

�I was absorbed, sir: yes, and I was happy.  To paint them, in short, was to enjoy one of the keenest pleasures I have ever known.�

�That is not saying much.  Your pleasures, by your own account, have been few; but I daresay you did exist in a kind of artist�s dreamland while you blent and arranged these strange tints.  Did you sit at them long each day?�

�I had nothing else to do, because it was the vacation, and I sat at them from morning till noon, and from noon till night: the length of the midsummer days favoured my inclination to apply.�

�And you felt self-satisfied with the result of your ardent labours?�

�Far from it.  I was tormented by the contrast between my idea and my handiwork: in each case I had imagined something which I was quite powerless to realise.�

�Not quite: you have secured the shadow of your thought; but no more, probably.  You had not enough of the artist�s skill and science to give it full being: yet the drawings are, for a school-girl, peculiar.  As to the thoughts, they are elfish.  These eyes in the Evening Star you must have seen in a dream.  How could you make them look so clear, and yet not at all brilliant? for the planet above quells their rays.  And what meaning is that in their solemn depth?  And who taught you to paint wind?  There is a high gale in that sky, and on this hill-top.  Where did you see Latmos?  For that is Latmos.  There! put the drawings away!�

I had scarce tied the strings of the portfolio, when, looking at his watch, he said abruptly�

�It is nine o�clock: what are you about, Miss Eyre, to let Adele sit up so long?  Take her to bed.�

Adele went to kiss him before quitting the room: he endured the caress, but scarcely seemed to relish it more than Pilot would have done, nor so much.

�I wish you all good-night, now,� said he, making a movement of the hand towards the door, in token that he was tired of our company, and wished to dismiss us.  Mrs. Fairfax folded up her knitting: I took my portfolio: we curtseyed to him, received a frigid bow in return, and so withdrew.

�You said Mr. Rochester was not strikingly peculiar, Mrs. Fairfax,� I observed, when I rejoined her in her room, after putting Adele to bed.

�Well, is he?�

�I think so: he is very changeful and abrupt.�

�True: no doubt he may appear so to a stranger, but I am so accustomed to his manner, I never think of it; and then, if he has peculiarities of temper, allowance should be made.�

�Why?�

�Partly because it is his nature�and we can none of us help our nature; and partly because he has painful thoughts, no doubt, to harass him, and make his spirits unequal.�

�What about?�

�Family troubles, for one thing.�

�But he has no family.�

�Not now, but he has had�or, at least, relatives.  He lost his elder brother a few years since.�

�His elder brother?�

�Yes.  The present Mr. Rochester has not been very long in possession of the property; only about nine years.�

�Nine years is a tolerable time.  Was he so very fond of his brother as to be still inconsolable for his loss?�

�Why, no�perhaps not.  I believe there were some misunderstandings between them.  Mr. Rowland Rochester was not quite just to Mr. Edward; and perhaps he prejudiced his father against him.  The old gentleman was fond of money, and anxious to keep the family estate together.  He did not like to diminish the property by division, and yet he was anxious that Mr. Edward should have wealth, too, to keep up the consequence of the name; and, soon after he was of age, some steps were taken that were not quite fair, and made a great deal of mischief.  Old Mr. Rochester and Mr. Rowland combined to bring Mr. Edward into what he considered a painful position, for the sake of making his fortune: what the precise nature of that position was I never clearly knew, but his spirit could not brook what he had to suffer in it.  He is not very forgiving: he broke with his family, and now for many years he has led an unsettled kind of life.  I don�t think he has ever been resident at Thornfield for a fortnight together, since the death of his brother without a will left him master of the estate; and, indeed, no wonder he shuns the old place.�

�Why should he shun it?�

�Perhaps he thinks it gloomy.�

The answer was evasive.  I should have liked something clearer; but Mrs. Fairfax either could not, or would not, give me more explicit information of the origin and nature of Mr. Rochester�s trials.  She averred they were a mystery to herself, and that what she knew was chiefly from conjecture.  It was evident, indeed, that she wished me to drop the subject, which I did accordingly.

CHAPTER XIV
For several subsequent days I saw little of Mr. Rochester.  In the mornings he seemed much engaged with business, and, in the afternoon, gentlemen from Millcote or the neighbourhood called, and sometimes stayed to dine with him.  When his sprain was well enough to admit of horse exercise, he rode out a good deal; probably to return these visits, as he generally did not come back till late at night.

During this interval, even Adele was seldom sent for to his presence, and all my acquaintance with him was confined to an occasional rencontre in the hall, on the stairs, or in the gallery, when he would sometimes pass me haughtily and coldly, just acknowledging my presence by a distant nod or a cool glance, and sometimes bow and smile with gentlemanlike affability.  His changes of mood did not offend me, because I saw that I had nothing to do with their alternation; the ebb and flow depended on causes quite disconnected with me.

One day he had had company to dinner, and had sent for my portfolio; in order, doubtless, to exhibit its contents: the gentlemen went away early, to attend a public meeting at Millcote, as Mrs. Fairfax informed me; but the night being wet and inclement, Mr. Rochester did not accompany them.  Soon after they were gone he rang the bell: a message came that I and Adele were to go downstairs.  I brushed Adele�s hair and made her neat, and having ascertained that I was myself in my usual Quaker trim, where there was nothing to retouch�all being too close and plain, braided locks included, to admit of disarrangement�we descended, Adele wondering whether the petit coffre was at length come; for, owing to some mistake, its arrival had hitherto been delayed.  She was gratified: there it stood, a little carton, on the table when we entered the dining-room.  She appeared to know it by instinct.

�Ma boite! ma boite!� exclaimed she, running towards it.

�Yes, there is your �boite� at last: take it into a corner, you genuine daughter of Paris, and amuse yourself with disembowelling it,� said the deep and rather sarcastic voice of Mr. Rochester, proceeding from the depths of an immense easy-chair at the fireside.  �And mind,� he continued, �don�t bother me with any details of the anatomical process, or any notice of the condition of the entrails: let your operation be conducted in silence: tiens-toi tranquille, enfant; comprends-tu?�

Adele seemed scarcely to need the warning�she had already retired to a sofa with her treasure, and was busy untying the cord which secured the lid.  Having removed this impediment, and lifted certain silvery envelopes of tissue paper, she merely exclaimed�

�Oh ciel!  Que c�est beau!� and then remained absorbed in ecstatic contemplation.

�Is Miss Eyre there?� now demanded the master, half rising from his seat to look round to the door, near which I still stood.

�Ah! well, come forward; be seated here.�  He drew a chair near his own.  �I am not fond of the prattle of children,� he continued; �for, old bachelor as I am, I have no pleasant associations connected with their lisp.  It would be intolerable to me to pass a whole evening tete-a-tete with a brat.  Don�t draw that chair farther off, Miss Eyre; sit down exactly where I placed it�if you please, that is.  Confound these civilities!  I continually forget them.  Nor do I particularly affect simple-minded old ladies.  By-the-bye, I must have mine in mind; it won�t do to neglect her; she is a Fairfax, or wed to one; and blood is said to be thicker than water.�

He rang, and despatched an invitation to Mrs. Fairfax, who soon arrived, knitting-basket in hand.

�Good evening, madam; I sent to you for a charitable purpose.  I have forbidden Adele to talk to me about her presents, and she is bursting with repletion: have the goodness to serve her as auditress and interlocutrice; it will be one of the most benevolent acts you ever performed.�

Adele, indeed, no sooner saw Mrs. Fairfax, than she summoned her to her sofa, and there quickly filled her lap with the porcelain, the ivory, the waxen contents of her �boite;� pouring out, meantime, explanations and raptures in such broken English as she was mistress of.

�Now I have performed the part of a good host,� pursued Mr. Rochester, �put my guests into the way of amusing each other, I ought to be at liberty to attend to my own pleasure.  Miss Eyre, draw your chair still a little farther forward: you are yet too far back; I cannot see you without disturbing my position in this comfortable chair, which I have no mind to do.�

I did as I was bid, though I would much rather have remained somewhat in the shade; but Mr. Rochester had such a direct way of giving orders, it seemed a matter of course to obey him promptly.

We were, as I have said, in the dining-room: the lustre, which had been lit for dinner, filled the room with a festal breadth of light; the large fire was all red and clear; the purple curtains hung rich and ample before the lofty window and loftier arch; everything was still, save the subdued chat of Adele (she dared not speak loud), and, filling up each pause, the beating of winter rain against the panes.

Mr. Rochester, as he sat in his damask-covered chair, looked different to what I had seen him look before; not quite so stern�much less gloomy.  There was a smile on his lips, and his eyes sparkled, whether with wine or not, I am not sure; but I think it very probable.  He was, in short, in his after-dinner mood; more expanded and genial, and also more self-indulgent than the frigid and rigid temper of the morning; still he looked preciously grim, cushioning his massive head against the swelling back of his chair, and receiving the light of the fire on his granite-hewn features, and in his great, dark eyes; for he had great, dark eyes, and very fine eyes, too�not without a certain change in their depths sometimes, which, if it was not softness, reminded you, at least, of that feeling.

He had been looking two minutes at the fire, and I had been looking the same length of time at him, when, turning suddenly, he caught my gaze fastened on his physiognomy.

�You examine me, Miss Eyre,� said he: �do you think me handsome?�

I should, if I had deliberated, have replied to this question by something conventionally vague and polite; but the answer somehow slipped from my tongue before I was aware��No, sir.�

�Ah!  By my word! there is something singular about you,� said he: �you have the air of a little nonnette; quaint, quiet, grave, and simple, as you sit with your hands before you, and your eyes generally bent on the carpet (except, by-the-bye, when they are directed piercingly to my face; as just now, for instance); and when one asks you a question, or makes a remark to which you are obliged to reply, you rap out a round rejoinder, which, if not blunt, is at least brusque.  What do you mean by it?�

�Sir, I was too plain; I beg your pardon.  I ought to have replied that it was not easy to give an impromptu answer to a question about appearances; that tastes mostly differ; and that beauty is of little consequence, or something of that sort.�

�You ought to have replied no such thing.  Beauty of little consequence, indeed!  And so, under pretence of softening the previous outrage, of stroking and soothing me into placidity, you stick a sly penknife under my ear!  Go on: what fault do you find with me, pray?  I suppose I have all my limbs and all my features like any other man?�

�Mr. Rochester, allow me to disown my first answer: I intended no pointed repartee: it was only a blunder.�

�Just so: I think so: and you shall be answerable for it.  Criticise me: does my forehead not please you?�

He lifted up the sable waves of hair which lay horizontally over his brow, and showed a solid enough mass of intellectual organs, but an abrupt deficiency where the suave sign of benevolence should have risen.

�Now, ma�am, am I a fool?�

�Far from it, sir.  You would, perhaps, think me rude if I inquired in return whether you are a philanthropist?�

�There again!  Another stick of the penknife, when she pretended to pat my head: and that is because I said I did not like the society of children and old women (low be it spoken!).  No, young lady, I am not a general philanthropist; but I bear a conscience;� and he pointed to the prominences which are said to indicate that faculty, and which, fortunately for him, were sufficiently conspicuous; giving, indeed, a marked breadth to the upper part of his head: �and, besides, I once had a kind of rude tenderness of heart.  When I was as old as you, I was a feeling fellow enough, partial to the unfledged, unfostered, and unlucky; but Fortune has knocked me about since: she has even kneaded me with her knuckles, and now I flatter myself I am hard and tough as an India-rubber ball; pervious, though, through a chink or two still, and with one sentient point in the middle of the lump.  Yes: does that leave hope for me?�

�Hope of what, sir?�

�Of my final re-transformation from India-rubber back to flesh?�

�Decidedly he has had too much wine,� I thought; and I did not know what answer to make to his queer question: how could I tell whether he was capable of being re-transformed?

�You looked very much puzzled, Miss Eyre; and though you are not pretty any more than I am handsome, yet a puzzled air becomes you; besides, it is convenient, for it keeps those searching eyes of yours away from my physiognomy, and busies them with the worsted flowers of the rug; so puzzle on.  Young lady, I am disposed to be gregarious and communicative to-night.�

With this announcement he rose from his chair, and stood, leaning his arm on the marble mantelpiece: in that attitude his shape was seen plainly as well as his face; his unusual breadth of chest, disproportionate almost to his length of limb.  I am sure most people would have thought him an ugly man; yet there was so much unconscious pride in his port; so much ease in his demeanour; such a look of complete indifference to his own external appearance; so haughty a reliance on the power of other qualities, intrinsic or adventitious, to atone for the lack of mere personal attractiveness, that, in looking at him, one inevitably shared the indifference, and, even in a blind, imperfect sense, put faith in the confidence.

�I am disposed to be gregarious and communicative to-night,� he repeated, �and that is why I sent for you: the fire and the chandelier were not sufficient company for me; nor would Pilot have been, for none of these can talk.  Adele is a degree better, but still far below the mark; Mrs. Fairfax ditto; you, I am persuaded, can suit me if you will: you puzzled me the first evening I invited you down here.  I have almost forgotten you since: other ideas have driven yours from my head; but to-night I am resolved to be at ease; to dismiss what importunes, and recall what pleases.  It would please me now to draw you out�to learn more of you�therefore speak.�

Instead of speaking, I smiled; and not a very complacent or submissive smile either.

�Speak,� he urged.

�What about, sir?�

�Whatever you like.  I leave both the choice of subject and the manner of treating it entirely to yourself.�

Accordingly I sat and said nothing: �If he expects me to talk for the mere sake of talking and showing off, he will find he has addressed himself to the wrong person,� I thought.

�You are dumb, Miss Eyre.�

I was dumb still.  He bent his head a little towards me, and with a single hasty glance seemed to dive into my eyes.

�Stubborn?� he said, �and annoyed.  Ah! it is consistent.  I put my request in an absurd, almost insolent form.  Miss Eyre, I beg your pardon.  The fact is, once for all, I don�t wish to treat you like an inferior: that is� (correcting himself), �I claim only such superiority as must result from twenty years� difference in age and a century�s advance in experience.  This is legitimate, et j�y tiens, as Adele would say; and it is by virtue of this superiority, and this alone, that I desire you to have the goodness to talk to me a little now, and divert my thoughts, which are galled with dwelling on one point�cankering as a rusty nail.�

He had deigned an explanation, almost an apology, and I did not feel insensible to his condescension, and would not seem so.

�I am willing to amuse you, if I can, sir�quite willing; but I cannot introduce a topic, because how do I know what will interest you?  Ask me questions, and I will do my best to answer them.�

�Then, in the first place, do you agree with me that I have a right to be a little masterful, abrupt, perhaps exacting, sometimes, on the grounds I stated, namely, that I am old enough to be your father, and that I have battled through a varied experience with many men of many nations, and roamed over half the globe, while you have lived quietly with one set of people in one house?�

�Do as you please, sir.�

�That is no answer; or rather it is a very irritating, because a very evasive one.  Reply clearly.�

�I don�t think, sir, you have a right to command me, merely because you are older than I, or because you have seen more of the world than I have; your claim to superiority depends on the use you have made of your time and experience.�

�Humph!  Promptly spoken.  But I won�t allow that, seeing that it would never suit my case, as I have made an indifferent, not to say a bad, use of both advantages.  Leaving superiority out of the question, then, you must still agree to receive my orders now and then, without being piqued or hurt by the tone of command.  Will you?�

I smiled: I thought to myself Mr. Rochester is peculiar�he seems to forget that he pays me ?30 per annum for receiving his orders.

�The smile is very well,� said he, catching instantly the passing expression; �but speak too.�

�I was thinking, sir, that very few masters would trouble themselves to inquire whether or not their paid subordinates were piqued and hurt by their orders.�

�Paid subordinates!  What! you are my paid subordinate, are you?  Oh yes, I had forgotten the salary!  Well then, on that mercenary ground, will you agree to let me hector a little?�

�No, sir, not on that ground; but, on the ground that you did forget it, and that you care whether or not a dependent is comfortable in his dependency, I agree heartily.�

�And will you consent to dispense with a great many conventional forms and phrases, without thinking that the omission arises from insolence?�

�I am sure, sir, I should never mistake informality for insolence: one I rather like, the other nothing free-born would submit to, even for a salary.�

�Humbug!  Most things free-born will submit to anything for a salary; therefore, keep to yourself, and don�t venture on generalities of which you are intensely ignorant.  However, I mentally shake hands with you for your answer, despite its inaccuracy; and as much for the manner in which it was said, as for the substance of the speech; the manner was frank and sincere; one does not often see such a manner: no, on the contrary, affectation, or coldness, or stupid, coarse-minded misapprehension of one�s meaning are the usual rewards of candour.  Not three in three thousand raw school-girl-governesses would have answered me as you have just done.  But I don�t mean to flatter you: if you are cast in a different mould to the majority, it is no merit of yours: Nature did it.  And then, after all, I go too fast in my conclusions: for what I yet know, you may be no better than the rest; you may have intolerable defects to counterbalance your few good points.�

�And so may you,� I thought.  My eye met his as the idea crossed my mind: he seemed to read the glance, answering as if its import had been spoken as well as imagined�

�Yes, yes, you are right,� said he; �I have plenty of faults of my own: I know it, and I don�t wish to palliate them, I assure you.  God wot I need not be too severe about others; I have a past existence, a series of deeds, a colour of life to contemplate within my own breast, which might well call my sneers and censures from my neighbours to myself.  I started, or rather (for like other defaulters, I like to lay half the blame on ill fortune and adverse circumstances) was thrust on to a wrong tack at the age of one-and-twenty, and have never recovered the right course since: but I might have been very different; I might have been as good as you�wiser�almost as stainless.  I envy you your peace of mind, your clean conscience, your unpolluted memory.  Little girl, a memory without blot or contamination must be an exquisite treasure�an inexhaustible source of pure refreshment: is it not?�

�How was your memory when you were eighteen, sir?�

�All right then; limpid, salubrious: no gush of bilge water had turned it to fetid puddle.  I was your equal at eighteen�quite your equal.  Nature meant me to be, on the whole, a good man, Miss Eyre; one of the better kind, and you see I am not so.  You would say you don�t see it; at least I flatter myself I read as much in your eye (beware, by-the-bye, what you express with that organ; I am quick at interpreting its language).  Then take my word for it,�I am not a villain: you are not to suppose that�not to attribute to me any such bad eminence; but, owing, I verily believe, rather to circumstances than to my natural bent, I am a trite commonplace sinner, hackneyed in all the poor petty dissipations with which the rich and worthless try to put on life.  Do you wonder that I avow this to you?  Know, that in the course of your future life you will often find yourself elected the involuntary confidant of your acquaintances� secrets: people will instinctively find out, as I have done, that it is not your forte to tell of yourself, but to listen while others talk of themselves; they will feel, too, that you listen with no malevolent scorn of their indiscretion, but with a kind of innate sympathy; not the less comforting and encouraging because it is very unobtrusive in its manifestations.�

�How do you know?�how can you guess all this, sir?�

�I know it well; therefore I proceed almost as freely as if I were writing my thoughts in a diary.  You would say, I should have been superior to circumstances; so I should�so I should; but you see I was not.  When fate wronged me, I had not the wisdom to remain cool: I turned desperate; then I degenerated.  Now, when any vicious simpleton excites my disgust by his paltry ribaldry, I cannot flatter myself that I am better than he: I am forced to confess that he and I are on a level.  I wish I had stood firm�God knows I do!  Dread remorse when you are tempted to err, Miss Eyre; remorse is the poison of life.�

�Repentance is said to be its cure, sir.�

�It is not its cure.  Reformation may be its cure; and I could reform�I have strength yet for that�if�but where is the use of thinking of it, hampered, burdened, cursed as I am?  Besides, since happiness is irrevocably denied me, I have a right to get pleasure out of life: and I will get it, cost what it may.�

�Then you will degenerate still more, sir.�

�Possibly: yet why should I, if I can get sweet, fresh pleasure?  And I may get it as sweet and fresh as the wild honey the bee gathers on the moor.�

�It will sting�it will taste bitter, sir.�

�How do you know?�you never tried it.  How very serious�how very solemn you look: and you are as ignorant of the matter as this cameo head� (taking one from the mantelpiece).  �You have no right to preach to me, you neophyte, that have not passed the porch of life, and are absolutely unacquainted with its mysteries.�

�I only remind you of your own words, sir: you said error brought remorse, and you pronounced remorse the poison of existence.�

�And who talks of error now?  I scarcely think the notion that flittered across my brain was an error.  I believe it was an inspiration rather than a temptation: it was very genial, very soothing�I know that.  Here it comes again!  It is no devil, I assure you; or if it be, it has put on the robes of an angel of light.  I think I must admit so fair a guest when it asks entrance to my heart.�

�Distrust it, sir; it is not a true angel.�

�Once more, how do you know?  By what instinct do you pretend to distinguish between a fallen seraph of the abyss and a messenger from the eternal throne�between a guide and a seducer?�

�I judged by your countenance, sir, which was troubled when you said the suggestion had returned upon you.  I feel sure it will work you more misery if you listen to it.�

�Not at all�it bears the most gracious message in the world: for the rest, you are not my conscience-keeper, so don�t make yourself uneasy.  Here, come in, bonny wanderer!�

He said this as if he spoke to a vision, viewless to any eye but his own; then, folding his arms, which he had half extended, on his chest, he seemed to enclose in their embrace the invisible being.

�Now,� he continued, again addressing me, �I have received the pilgrim�a disguised deity, as I verily believe.  Already it has done me good: my heart was a sort of charnel; it will now be a shrine.�

�To speak truth, sir, I don�t understand you at all: I cannot keep up the conversation, because it has got out of my depth.  Only one thing, I know: you said you were not as good as you should like to be, and that you regretted your own imperfection;�one thing I can comprehend: you intimated that to have a sullied memory was a perpetual bane.  It seems to me, that if you tried hard, you would in time find it possible to become what you yourself would approve; and that if from this day you began with resolution to correct your thoughts and actions, you would in a few years have laid up a new and stainless store of recollections, to which you might revert with pleasure.�

�Justly thought; rightly said, Miss Eyre; and, at this moment, I am paving hell with energy.�

�Sir?�

�I am laying down good intentions, which I believe durable as flint.  Certainly, my associates and pursuits shall be other than they have been.�

�And better?�

�And better�so much better as pure ore is than foul dross.  You seem to doubt me; I don�t doubt myself: I know what my aim is, what my motives are; and at this moment I pass a law, unalterable as that of the Medes and Persians, that both are right.�

�They cannot be, sir, if they require a new statute to legalise them.�

�They are, Miss Eyre, though they absolutely require a new statute: unheard-of combinations of circumstances demand unheard-of rules.�

�That sounds a dangerous maxim, sir; because one can see at once that it is liable to abuse.�

�Sententious sage! so it is: but I swear by my household gods not to abuse it.�

�You are human and fallible.�

�I am: so are you�what then?�

�The human and fallible should not arrogate a power with which the divine and perfect alone can be safely intrusted.�

�What power?�

�That of saying of any strange, unsanctioned line of action,��Let it be right.��

��Let it be right��the very words: you have pronounced them.�

�May it be right then,� I said, as I rose, deeming it useless to continue a discourse which was all darkness to me; and, besides, sensible that the character of my interlocutor was beyond my penetration; at least, beyond its present reach; and feeling the uncertainty, the vague sense of insecurity, which accompanies a conviction of ignorance.

�Where are you going?�

�To put Adele to bed: it is past her bedtime.�

�You are afraid of me, because I talk like a Sphynx.�

�Your language is enigmatical, sir: but though I am bewildered, I am certainly not afraid.�

�You are afraid�your self-love dreads a blunder.�

�In that sense I do feel apprehensive�I have no wish to talk nonsense.�

�If you did, it would be in such a grave, quiet manner, I should mistake it for sense.  Do you never laugh, Miss Eyre?  Don�t trouble yourself to answer�I see you laugh rarely; but you can laugh very merrily: believe me, you are not naturally austere, any more than I am naturally vicious.  The Lowood constraint still clings to you somewhat; controlling your features, muffling your voice, and restricting your limbs; and you fear in the presence of a man and a brother�or father, or master, or what you will�to smile too gaily, speak too freely, or move too quickly: but, in time, I think you will learn to be natural with me, as I find it impossible to be conventional with you; and then your looks and movements will have more vivacity and variety than they dare offer now.  I see at intervals the glance of a curious sort of bird through the close-set bars of a cage: a vivid, restless, resolute captive is there; were it but free, it would soar cloud-high.  You are still bent on going?�

�It has struck nine, sir.�

�Never mind,�wait a minute: Adele is not ready to go to bed yet.  My position, Miss Eyre, with my back to the fire, and my face to the room, favours observation.  While talking to you, I have also occasionally watched Adele (I have my own reasons for thinking her a curious study,�reasons that I may, nay, that I shall, impart to you some day).  She pulled out of her box, about ten minutes ago, a little pink silk frock; rapture lit her face as she unfolded it; coquetry runs in her blood, blends with her brains, and seasons the marrow of her bones.  �Il faut que je l�essaie!� cried she, �et a l�instant meme!� and she rushed out of the room.  She is now with Sophie, undergoing a robing process: in a few minutes she will re-enter; and I know what I shall see,�a miniature of Celine Varens, as she used to appear on the boards at the rising of�But never mind that.  However, my tenderest feelings are about to receive a shock: such is my presentiment; stay now, to see whether it will be realised.�

Ere long, Adele�s little foot was heard tripping across the hall.  She entered, transformed as her guardian had predicted.  A dress of rose-coloured satin, very short, and as full in the skirt as it could be gathered, replaced the brown frock she had previously worn; a wreath of rosebuds circled her forehead; her feet were dressed in silk stockings and small white satin sandals.

�Est-ce que ma robe va bien?� cried she, bounding forwards; �et mes souliers? et mes bas?  Tenez, je crois que je vais danser!�

And spreading out her dress, she chasseed across the room till, having reached Mr. Rochester, she wheeled lightly round before him on tip-toe, then dropped on one knee at his feet, exclaiming�

�Monsieur, je vous remercie mille fois de votre bonte;� then rising, she added, �C�est comme cela que maman faisait, n�est-ce pas, monsieur?�

�Pre-cise-ly!� was the answer; �and, �comme cela,� she charmed my English gold out of my British breeches� pocket.  I have been green, too, Miss Eyre,�ay, grass green: not a more vernal tint freshens you now than once freshened me.  My Spring is gone, however, but it has left me that French floweret on my hands, which, in some moods, I would fain be rid of.  Not valuing now the root whence it sprang; having found that it was of a sort which nothing but gold dust could manure, I have but half a liking to the blossom, especially when it looks so artificial as just now.  I keep it and rear it rather on the Roman Catholic principle of expiating numerous sins, great or small, by one good work.  I�ll explain all this some day.  Good-night.�

CHAPTER XV
